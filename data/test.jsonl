{"Question": "What is Sulfasalazine used for?", "Answer": "Sulfasalazine is a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) used to treat and manage autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and an inflammatory bowel disease called ulcerative colitis. It is a slow-acting DMARD, taking time to build up and start working. Sulfasalazine helps to reduce pain and swelling and lowers inflammation in your body. It limits the damage that rheumatoid arthritis causes to your joints, helping to prevent disease progression. Sulfasalazine consists of the anti-inflammatory agent 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA, mesalamine or mesalazine) and the antibiotic sulfapyridine, which are linked by a bond. It's not fully understood how sulfasalazine works. Sulfasalazine is too big to be absorbed by your small intestine, but bacteria in your colon can break the bond between 5-ASA and sulfapyridine, which frees 5-ASA to work locally in your colon to help in ulcerative colitis. Sulfasalazine and its metabolites - the other drugs that it is broken down into - are also thought to have a range of immunomodulatory effects. They block or inhibit certain processes in your body, which helps to reduce the activity of your immune system. Sulfasalazine has been used since the 1950s. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a standard tablet (Azulfidine) and an enteric-coated, delayed-release tablet (Azulfidine EN-tabs) of sulfazalazine.

{"Question": "What are the warnings for Linezolid?", "Answer": "Known hypersensitivity to linezolid or any ingredient in the formulation. Current or recent (within the last 2 weeks) treatment with drugs that inhibit MAO A or B (e.g., isocarboxazid, phenelzine). (See Specific Drugs under Interactions.) Myelosuppression (anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia) reported. Toxicity studies in adult and juvenile dogs and rats indicate myelosuppression (bone marrow hypocellularity/decreased hematopoiesis; decreased extramedullary hematopoiesis in spleen and liver; decreased levels of circulating erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets) and lymphoid depletion in thymus, lymph nodes, and spleen. Monitor CBCs weekly during linezolid treatment, especially in those receiving the drug for >2 weeks and in those who have preexisting myelosuppression, are receiving concomitant drugs associated with bone marrow suppression, or have a chronic infection that was or is being treated with concomitant anti-infective therapy. Consider discontinuing linezolid if myelosuppression develops or worsens. Hematologic parameters generally have increased toward pretreatment values following discontinuance of the drug. Peripheral and optic neuropathies reported in adults and children receiving linezolid, principally in those receiving the drug for >28 days. Optic neuropathy progressing to loss of vision reported when linezolid used for >28 days. Blurred vision reported in some patients who received the drug for <28 days. If patient experiences symptoms of visual impairment (e.g., changes in visual acuity or color vision, blurred vision, visual field defect), promptly perform an ophthalmic evaluation. Monitor visual function in all patients receiving linezolid for extended periods of time (i.e., \u22653 months). In addition, monitor visual function in all patients reporting a new visual symptom, regardless of length of linezolid treatment. If peripheral or optic neuropathy occurs, weigh potential benefits versus risks of continued linezolid treatment. Serotonin syndrome (including some fatalities) reported in patients receiving linezolid concomitantly with serotonergic drugs. Signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome include mental changes (confusion, hyperactivity, memory problems), muscle twitching, excessive sweating, shivering, shaking, diarrhea, loss of coordination, and/or fever. Most reported cases occurred in patients receiving linezolid concomitantly with SSRIs or SNRIs. FDA has not concluded whether concomitant use of linezolid with other drugs with lesser degrees of serotonergic activity (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, MAO inhibitors) is associated with a risk comparable to that reported with SSRIs or SNRIs. Unless considered clinically appropriate and patients can be carefully monitored for signs and/or symptoms of serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome-like (NMS-like) reactions, do not use linezolid in patients with carcinoid syndrome or in patients receiving SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin 5-HT 1 receptor agonists (triptans), meperidine, bupropion, or buspirone. (See Specific Drugs under Interactions.) In cases when patient is already receiving a serotonergic antidepressant or buspirone and urgent treatment with linezolid is required (e.g., life-threatening infection caused by MRSA or vancomycin-resistant E. faecium ) and alternatives to linezolid are not available and potential benefits of the drug outweigh risks of serotonin syndrome or NMS-like reactions, stop the serotonergic antidepressant promptly and administer linezolid. Monitor for manifestations of serotonin syndrome or NMS-like reactions (e.g., hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability, mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma) for 2 weeks (5 weeks if fluoxetine was taken) or until 24 hours after last linezolid dose, whichever comes first. Also monitor for symptoms associated with discontinuance of the antidepressant. In an investigational study in seriously ill patients with intravascular catheter-related infections \u2020 [off-label] , mortality was higher in patients receiving linezolid than in patients receiving a comparator anti-infective (vancomycin, oxacillin, dicloxacillin); patients also could receive concomitant therapy for gram-negative infection. There was no difference in mortality between linezolid and comparator regimens in patients with only gram-positive bacteria identified in the baseline culture; mortality was higher in linezolid-treated patients with gram-negative bacterial infections, mixed gram-positive and gram-negative infections, or no pathogen identified at baseline. Causality not established. Not approved by FDA for treatment of catheter-related bacteremia or catheter-site infections; not approved for treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections. Linezolid is a weak, nonselective, reversible inhibitor of MAO, and potentially may interact with MAO inhibitors and adrenergic and serotonergic agents. (See Specific Drugs under Interactions.) Significant pressor response reported when tyramine doses >100 mg were used in adults receiving linezolid. Instruct patients to avoid large quantities of foods or beverages with high tyramine content during linezolid treatment. Foods high in tyramine content include those that may have undergone protein changes by aging, fermentation, pickling, or smoking to improve flavor (e.g., aged cheeses, fermented or air-dried meat, sauerkraut, soy sauce, tap beer, red wine). Consider that tyramine content of any protein-rich food may be increased if stored for long periods or improperly refrigerated. Unless monitored for potential increases in BP, do not use linezolid in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, pheochromocytoma, or thyrotoxicosis or in patients receiving direct- or indirect-acting sympathomimetic agents (e.g., pseudoephedrine), vasopressor agents (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), or dopaminergic agents (e.g., dopamine, dobutamine). (See Specific Drugs under Interactions.) Lactic acidosis, characterized by recurrent nausea and vomiting, reported. Patients who develop recurrent nausea and vomiting, unexplained acidosis, or a low bicarbonate concentration while receiving linezolid should undergo immediate medical evaluation. Seizures reported; history of seizures or risk factors for seizures noted in some cases. Symptomatic hypoglycemia reported in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving linezolid concomitantly with insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Although causal relationship between linezolid and hypoglycemia not established, caution patients with diabetes mellitus about potential for hypoglycemia during linezolid treatment. If hypoglycemia occurs, dosage reduction of insulin or oral antidiabetic agents or discontinuance of linezolid, insulin, or oral antidiabetic agents may be necessary. Anaphylaxis, angioedema, and bullous skin disorders, including severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, reported. Superficial tooth discoloration and tongue discoloration reported. In cases with known outcome, tooth discoloration was removable with professional dental cleaning (manual descaling). Oral suspension contains aspartame, which is metabolized in the GI tract to provide 20 mg of phenylalanine per 5 mL of suspension. Linezolid tablets do not contain aspartame and should be used in individuals with phenylketonuria (i.e., homozygous genetic deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase) and other individuals who must restrict their intake of phenylalanine. Possible emergence and overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Monitor carefully; institute appropriate therapy if superinfection occurs. Treatment with anti-infectives alters normal colon flora and may permit overgrowth of Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile ). C. difficile infection (CDI) and C. difficile -associated diarrhea and colitis (CDAD; also known as antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis or pseudomembranous colitis) reported with nearly all anti-infectives, including linezolid, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD; hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile are associated with increased morbidity and mortality since they may be refractory to anti-infectives and colectomy may be required. Consider CDAD if diarrhea develops during or after therapy and manage accordingly. Obtain careful medical history since CDAD may occur as late as \u22652 months or longer after anti-infective therapy is discontinued. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, discontinue anti-infectives not directed against C. difficile whenever possible. Initiate appropriate anti-infective therapy directed against C. difficile (e.g., fidaxomicin, vancomycin, metronidazole), supportive therapy (e.g., fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation), and surgical evaluation as clinically indicated. Linezolid is indicated only for treatment of certain infections caused by certain gram-positive bacteria. The drug has no clinical activity against gram-negative bacteria and is not indicated for treatment of infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. It is imperative that an anti-infective active against gram-negative bacteria be used concomitantly if documented or presumptive pathogens also include gram-negative bacteria. (See Uses.) Safety and efficacy of linezolid given for >28 days not evaluated in controlled clinical trials. (See Dosage under Dosage and Administration.) To reduce development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of linezolid and other antibacterials, use only for treatment of infections proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When selecting or modifying anti-infective therapy, use results of culture and in vitro susceptibility testing. In the absence of such data, consider local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns when selecting anti-infectives for empiric therapy. Information on test methods and quality control standards for in vitro susceptibility testing of antibacterials and specific interpretive criteria for such testing recognized by FDA is available at [Web] . For most antibacterials, including linezolid, FDA recognizes the standards published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Available data from published and postmarketing case reports regarding use of linezolid in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes In mice, rats, and rabbits, linezolid was not teratogenic; however, embryofetal toxicities reported (e.g, post-implantational embryo death, decreased fetal body weights, increased incidence of costal cartilage fusion, reduced ossification). Distributed into human milk; not known whether the drug affects the breast-fed infant or affects milk production. Consider benefits of breast-feeding and the importance of linezolid to the woman along with potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition. If used in a nursing woman, manufacturer recommends monitoring breast-fed infant for diarrhea and vomiting since these are the most common adverse reactions reported in infants being treated with linezolid. Based on findings from animal studies, linezolid may reversibly impair fertility in males. In adult male rats, reversible decrease in fertility and reproductive performance reported. The effects on fertility were mediated through altered spermatogenesis; affected spermatids contained abnormally formed and oriented mitochondria and were nonviable. Epithelial cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia in the epididymis observed in conjunction with decreased fertility. Safety and efficacy for treatment of CAP, nosocomial pneumonia, complicated skin and skin structure infections, and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium infections in pediatric patients are supported by adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, pharmacokinetic studies in pediatric patients, and additional data from a comparator-controlled study of gram-positive infections in neonates and children through 11 years of age. Safety and efficacy for treatment of CAP in pediatric patients also is supported by evidence from an uncontrolled study in patients 8 months through 12 years of age. Safety and efficacy for treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections in pediatric patients established in a comparator-controlled study in pediatric patients 5\u201317 years of age. In children with a suboptimal response to linezolid, especially those with infections caused by pathogens with linezolid MICs of 4 mcg/mL, consider inadequate systemic exposure, site and severity of infection, and underlying medical conditions. Manufacturer states not recommended for empiric treatment of CNS infections in pediatric patients. (See Distribution under Pharmacokinetics.) Pharmacokinetic, safety, and efficacy profiles similar to those in younger adults. Possibility of greater sensitivity in some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A or B): Pharmacokinetics not altered. Severe hepatic impairment: Pharmacokinetics not evaluated. Although clinical importance not determined, the 2 principal metabolites of linezolid may accumulate in patients with impaired renal function; amount of accumulation increases with severity of renal impairment. Weigh potential benefits against potential risks of accumulation of linezolid metabolites. (See Renal Impairment under Dosage and Administration.) GI effects (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, localized or generalized abdominal pain, loose stools), headache, rash, dizziness, anemia, thrombocytopenia."}

Ask your doctor about any risk."}
{"Question": "What is Finasteride used for?", "Answer": "Finasteride tablets are used for hair loss in men (androgenetic alopecia), to help improve hair growth and hair count over time. Finasteride is also used for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men with an enlarged prostate to improve urinary symptoms by reducing prostate size, and may delay the need for surgery. Finasteride is only available as a prescription medicine. In male-pattern hair loss, a hormone called DHT (dihydrotestosterone) causes hair to become shorter and finer and eventually stop growing in the affected area. DHT also causes the prostate to grow larger. Finasteride works by reducing the amount of DHT available by blocking an enzyme called 5\u03b1-reductase, which converts testosterone into DHT. Lower levels of DHT help improve hair growth in male pattern hair loss and reduce symptoms of BPH. Finasteride is from a class of medicines called 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors. Finasteride 5mg tablets are used to treat symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men, and finasteride 1mg tablets are used to treat male pattern hair loss in men. Finasteride\u2019s first FDA approval was under the brand name Proscar (finasteride 5mg tablets) on June 19, 1992, for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men with an enlarged prostate.

Nicotine polacrilex gum in patients with temporomandibular joint disease. (See Oral and Dental Effects under Cautions.) Risk of nicotine toxicity (e.g., nausea, hypersalivation, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, perspiration, headache, dizziness, hearing and visual disturbances, mental confusion, weakness) and addiction. Sustained use of nicotine preparations is not recommended. Weigh risk of nicotine replacement against hazard of continued smoking concurrent with nicotine replacement therapy and likelihood of smoking cessation without nicotine replacement. Discontinue nicotine polacrilex lozenges if symptoms suggestive of overdosage (nausea, vomiting, dizziness, diarrhea, weakness, and rapid heartbeat) occur. Animal studies indicate fetal harm; pregnant women should attempt smoking cessation with educational and behavioral interventions before considering nicotine therapy. Use during pregnancy only if the increased likelihood of smoking cessation justifies potential risk to the fetus and patient of nicotine replacement and possible continued smoking. If used during pregnancy or if patient becomes pregnant, apprise of potential fetal hazard. Possible exacerbation of bronchospasm. Use oral inhaler with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease; other dosage forms may be preferable. Intranasal nicotine is not recommended in patients with severe reactive airway disease. Nicotine nasal spray may irritate nasal mucosa; use of nasal spray not recommended in patients with a history of chronic nasal disorders (e.g., allergy, rhinitis, polyps, sinusitis). Discontinue nicotine polacrilex lozenges if severe sore throat occurs.

{"Question": "What are the warnings for Heparin Sodium?", "Answer": "Uncontrollable bleeding, unless such bleeding is secondary to disseminated intravascular coagulation. Severe thrombocytopenia, history of HIT, or HIT with thrombosis. Inability to perform suitable blood coagulation tests at required intervals in patients receiving full-dose therapy. Lack of such tests generally is not a contraindication for fixed low-dose therapy, since monitoring of coagulation tests usually is not required. Known hypersensitivity to heparin or pork products. (See Sensitivity Reactions under Cautions.) Hemorrhage can range from minor local ecchymoses to major hemorrhagic complications. Bleeding may occur at any site; some hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect. Use with extreme caution in patients with an increased risk of hemorrhage. Such patients include those with subacute bacterial endocarditis; ulcerative GI lesions; hemorrhagic blood dyscrasias (e.g., hemophilia, some vascular purpuras, thrombocytopenia); menstruation; hepatic disease with impaired hemostasis; severe hypertension; major surgery, especially involving the eye, brain, or spinal cord; continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine; and spinal tap or spinal anesthesia. Screen patients prior to treatment initiation to rule out bleeding disorders. Monitor patients with appropriate coagulation tests just prior to surgery. Discontinue therapy immediately if hemorrhage occurs or if coagulation tests are unduly prolonged. Nosebleed, hematuria, or tarry stools may be noted as the first sign of bleeding or overdosage. Easy bruising or petechiae may precede frank bleeding. If severe hemorrhage or overdosage occurs, administer protamine sulfate immediately. Blood transfusions may also be required following massive blood loss. If signs and symptoms of acute adrenal hemorrhage and insufficiency occur, measure plasma cortisol concentrations. Initiate vigorous therapy with IV corticosteroids after discontinuance. Do not delay initiation of corrective therapy until laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis, since any delay may be fatal. Perform periodic hematocrit and tests for occult blood in stool during the entire course of therapy. Obtain baseline aPTT value prior to insertion of an indwelling venipuncture device (e.g., heparin lock) since repeated injections of small doses of heparin sodium can alter aPTT results. Risk of thrombocytopenia, including HIT (immune-mediated reaction caused by development of IgG platelet-aggregating antibodies). (See HIT under Cautions and also see Contraindications under Cautions.) Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. Mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count >100,000/mm 3 ) may remain stable or reverse with continued therapy. If clinically important HIT occurs, discontinue the drug immediately and substitute a nonheparin anticoagulant (e.g., argatroban, bivalirudin). Generally contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to the drug. Patients with documented hypersensitivity should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Risk of HIT; may lead to severe thromboembolic complications including DVT, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, mesenteric thrombosis, renal artery thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities (possibly requiring amputation), MI, PE, stroke, and possibly, death. Can occur even with heparin lock flush solutions. Usually evident 5\u201310 days after exposure to heparin, but can occur more rapidly (e.g., within 24 hours) or as late as several weeks after discontinuance of therapy. If HIT with or without thrombosis is diagnosed or strongly suspected, discontinue all sources of heparin (including heparin flushes) and substitute a nonheparin anticoagulant (e.g., argatroban, bivalirudin). Initiate conversion to warfarin therapy only after substantial recovery from acute HIT has occurred (i.e., platelet counts \u2265150,000/mm 3 ). The manufacturer recommends against future use of heparin in patients who experience HIT, particularly within 3\u20136 months following the event and if HIT antibodies are still present. Evaluate patients who develop thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after treatment discontinuance for HIT and HIT with thrombosis. Increased resistance to the antithrombotic effects of heparin reported; associated with fever, MI, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, thrombosis, antithrombin III deficiency, malignant neoplasms, and surgery (i.e., postoperatively). Fatal medication errors (including in pediatric patients) have occurred as a result of confusion between different formulations of heparin, in particular with heparin sodium injection and catheter lock flush vials. Ensure accuracy of dispensing; take appropriate measures to carefully distinguish between heparin formulations when dispensing and review all labels for correct drug name, strength, and volume. Report dispensing errors to manufacturers or directly to FDA MedWatch program by phone (800-FDA-1088), fax (800-FDA-1078), or internet ( [Web] ). Category C. Manufacturers recommend use of a preservative (benzyl alcohol)-free formulation in pregnant women. Not likely to be distributed into milk. However, if benzyl alcohol is present in maternal serum, it is likely to distribute into milk and be absorbed by a nursing infant. Caution is advised when using heparin in nursing women; manufacturers recommend use of a preservative (benzyl alcohol)-free formulation. ACCP recommends that heparin be continued in nursing women who are already receiving such therapy. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies evaluating use of heparin in pediatric patients. Some heparin sodium injections and heparin lock flush solutions contain benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Large amounts of benzyl alcohol (i.e., 100\u2013400 mg/kg daily) have been associated with toxicity (e.g., \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d) in neonates. Manufacturers recommend use of preservative-free formulations in neonates and infants. AAP states that presence of small amounts of this preservative in a commercially available injection should not proscribe its use when indicated in neonates. If other benzyl alcohol-containing preparations are being used, consider the total daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources. Fatal medication dispensing errors reported in pediatric patients, including neonates. Take appropriate precautions when dispensing and administering the drug. (See Dispensing and Administration Precautions under Cautions.) Because of the potential risk of systemic anticoagulation, avoid use of heparin lock flush solutions containing 100 units/mL in neonates and in infants <10 kg. Caution also advised when using heparin lock flush solutions containing 10 units/mL in premature infants <1 kg who are receiving frequent flushes. Manufacturers state that risk of hemorrhage may be higher in patients >60 years of age, particularly women. (See Geriatric Patients and see Women under Dosage and Administration.) Patients with renal failure may be at increased risk of bleeding complications. Hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT or HIT with thrombosis, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, elevated aminotransferase concentrations."}

{"Question": "What is Zopiclone used for?", "Answer": "Zopiclone is a medication used to treat a sleeping problem called insomnia . Zopiclone is a sleeping pill that belongs to a group of drugs called non-benzodiazepine hypnotics. It has a different structure to benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics, such as Halcion (triazolam), but has similar benefits and side effects. Zopiclone helps to reduce the amount of time it takes you to fall asleep (sleep latency), increase the amount of time you sleep for (sleep duration), and decrease the number of times you wake up at night (nocturnal awakenings). Zopiclone starts to work quickly, taking about an hour to work. Zopiclone works by binding to a receptor in your brain called the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor and enhancing the action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a chemical messenger that has a calming effect. Zopiclone became available in the 1980s and is approved for use in many parts of the world. However, it is not available in the US where it is a schedule IV controlled substance. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved eszopiclone ( Lunesta ). Eszopiclone is a stereoisomer of zopiclone, which means it is made up of the same parts connected in the same sequences, but its 3D structure is different. Zopiclone usually comes as a tablet. In some countries, your doctor may be able to order you an oral solution containing this medication if you have trouble swallowing. Branded and generic versions of zopiclone are available."}

{"Question": "What is Moxifloxacin used for?", "Answer": "Treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis caused by susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , or Moraxella catarrhalis . Treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis caused by susceptible S. pneumoniae , H. influenzae , H. parainfluenzae , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Staphylococcus aureus , or M. catarrhalis . Use for treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis or acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis only when no other treatment options available. Because systemic fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, have been associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions (e.g., tendinitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, CNS effects) that can occur together in the same patient (see Cautions) and because acute bacterial sinusitis and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis may be self-limiting in some patients, risks of serious adverse reactions outweigh benefits of fluoroquinolones for patients with these infections. Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by susceptible S. pneumoniae (including multidrug-resistant strains; MDRSP), S. aureus (methicillin-susceptible [oxacillin-susceptible] strains), K. pneumoniae , H. influenzae , M. catarrhalis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , or Chlamydophila pneumoniae (formerly Chlamydia pneumoniae ). Select regimen for empiric treatment of CAP based on most likely pathogens and local susceptibility patterns; after pathogen is identified, modify to provide more specific therapy (pathogen-directed therapy). Has been used for treatment of nosocomial pneumonia \u2020 [off-label] . Select regimen for empiric treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) not associated with mechanical ventilation or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) based on local susceptibility data. If a fluoroquinolone used for initial empiric treatment of HAP or VAP, IDSA and ATS recommend ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin. Consult current IDSA clinical practice guidelines available at [Web] for additional information on management of respiratory tract infections. Treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (abscesses, furuncles, cellulitis, impetigo) caused by susceptible S. aureus (methicillin-susceptible [oxacillin-susceptible] strains) or S. pyogenes (group A \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci). Treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by susceptible S. aureus (oxacillin-susceptible strains), Escherichia coli , K. pneumoniae , or Enterobacter cloacae . Consult current IDSA clinical practice guidelines available at [Web] for additional information on management of skin and skin structure infections. Treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (including polymicrobial infections such as abscess) caused by susceptible Bacteroides fragilis , B. thetaiotaomicron , Clostridium perfringens , Enterococcus faecalis , E. coli , Proteus mirabilis , S. anginosus , S. constellatus , or Peptostreptococcus . Has been recommended as one of several options for initial empiric treatment of mild to moderate, community-acquired intra-abdominal infections. IDSA states avoid moxifloxacin in patients who received a quinolone within the past 3 months and are likely to harbor B. fragilis since such strains likely to be resistant to the drug. Consult current IDSA clinical practice guidelines available at [Web] for additional information on management of intra-abdominal infections. Alternative for treatment of endocarditis \u2020 [off-label] (native or prosthetic valve or other prosthetic material) caused by fastidious gram-negative bacilli known as the HACEK group ( Haemophilus , Aggregatibacter , Cardiobacterium hominis , Eikenella corrodens , Kingella ). AHA and IDSA recommend ceftriaxone (or other third or fourth generation cephalosporin), but state that a fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) may be considered in patients who cannot tolerate cephalosporins. Consultation with an infectious disease specialist recommended. Alternative for treatment of campylobacteriosis \u2020 [off-label] caused by susceptible Campylobacter . Optimal treatment of campylobacteriosis in HIV-infected patients not identified. Some clinicians withhold anti-infective treatment in those with CD4 + T-cell counts >200 cells/mm 3 and mild campylobacteriosis and initiate treatment if symptoms persist for more than several days. In those with mild to moderate campylobacteriosis, treatment with a fluoroquinolone (preferably ciprofloxacin or, alternatively, levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) or azithromycin is reasonable. Modify anti-infective treatment based on results of in vitro susceptibility; resistance to fluoroquinolones reported in 22% of C. jejuni and 35% of C. coli isolates tested in the US. Treatment of Salmonella gastroenteritis \u2020 [off-label] . CDC, NIH, and HIV Medicine Association of IDSA recommend ciprofloxacin as initial drug of choice for treatment of Salmonella gastroenteritis (with or without bacteremia) in HIV-infected adults; other fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) also likely to be effective, but data limited. Depending on in vitro susceptibility, alternatives are co-trimoxazole and third generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime). Role of long-term anti-infective treatment (secondary prophylaxis) against Salmonella in HIV-infected individuals with recurrent bacteremia or gastritis not well established; weigh benefits of such prophylaxis against risks of long-term anti-infective therapy. Treatment of shigellosis \u2020 [off-label] caused by susceptible Shigella . Anti-infectives may not be required for mild infections, but generally indicated in addition to fluid and electrolyte replacement for treatment of patients with severe shigellosis, dysentery, or underlying immunosuppression. Empiric treatment regimen can be used initially, but in vitro susceptibility testing indicated since resistance is common. Fluoroquinolones (preferably ciprofloxacin or, alternatively, levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) have been recommended for treatment of shigellosis in HIV-infected adults, but consider that fluoroquinolone-resistant Shigella reported in the US, especially in international travelers, the homeless, and men who have sex with men (MSM). Depending on in vitro susceptibility, other drugs recommended for treatment of shigellosis include co-trimoxazole, ceftriaxone, azithromycin (not recommended in those with bacteremia), or ampicillin. Alternative for postexposure prophylaxis of anthrax \u2020 following suspected or confirmed exposure to aerosolized Bacillus anthracis spores (inhalational anthrax). CDC, AAP, US Working Group on Civilian Biodefense, and US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) recommend oral ciprofloxacin and oral doxycycline as initial drugs of choice for prophylaxis following such exposures, including exposures that occur in the context of biologic warfare or bioterrorism. Other oral fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, ofloxacin) are alternatives when ciprofloxacin or doxycycline cannot be used. Treatment of uncomplicated cutaneous anthrax \u2020 (without systemic involvement) that occurs in the context of biologic warfare or bioterrorism. CDC states that preferred drugs for such infections include ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, levofloxacin, or moxifloxacin. Alternative to ciprofloxacin for use in multiple-drug parenteral regimen for initial treatment of systemic anthrax \u2020 (inhalational, GI, meningitis, or cutaneous with systemic involvement, head or neck lesions, or extensive edema) that occurs in the context of biologic warfare or bioterrorism. For initial treatment of systemic anthrax with possible or confirmed meningitis, CDC and AAP recommend a regimen of IV ciprofloxacin in conjunction with another IV bactericidal anti-infective (preferably meropenem) and an IV protein synthesis inhibitor (preferably linezolid). If meningitis excluded, these experts recommend an initial regimen of IV ciprofloxacin in conjunction with an IV protein synthesis inhibitor (preferably clindamycin or linezolid). Has been suggested as possible alternative to ciprofloxacin for treatment of inhalational anthrax \u2020 when a parenteral regimen not available (e.g., supply or logistic problems because large numbers of individuals require treatment in a mass casualty setting). Alternative for treatment of meningitis \u2020 caused by certain susceptible gram-positive bacteria (e.g., S. pneumoniae ). Fluoroquinolones have been recommended as alternatives for treatment of meningitis caused by some gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Neisseria meningitidis , H. influenzae , E. coli , Ps. aeruginosa ). Limited data from animal studies indicate moxifloxacin has been effective for treatment of experimental meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae or E. coli . Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin) should be considered for treatment of meningitis only when the infection is caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli or when the usually recommended anti-infectives cannot be used or have been ineffective. Alternative (second-line) agent for use in multiple-drug regimens for treatment of active tuberculosis \u2020 caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Although potential role of fluoroquinolones and optimal length of therapy not fully defined, ATS, CDC, IDSA, and others state that use of fluoroquinolones as alternative (second-line) agents can be considered for treatment of active tuberculosis in patients intolerant to certain first-line agents and in those with relapse, treatment failure, or M. tuberculosis resistant to certain first-line agents. If a fluoroquinolone used in multiple-drug regimens for treatment of active tuberculosis, ATS, CDC, IDSA, and others recommend levofloxacin or moxifloxacin. Consider that fluoroquinolone-resistant M. tuberculosis reported and there are increasing reports of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR tuberculosis). XDR tuberculosis is caused by M. tuberculosis resistant to rifampin and isoniazid (multiple-drug resistant strains) that also are resistant to a fluoroquinolone and at least one parenteral second-line antimycobacterial (capreomycin, kanamycin, amikacin). Consult most recent ATS, CDC, and IDSA recommendations for treatment of tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections for more specific information. Has been used in multiple-drug regimens for treatment of disseminated infections caused by Mycobacterium avium complex \u2020 (MAC). ATS and IDSA state that role of fluoroquinolones in treatment of MAC infections not established. If a fluoroquinolone is included in treatment regimen (e.g., for macrolide-resistant MAC infections), moxifloxacin or levofloxacin may be preferred, although many strains are resistant in vitro. Treatment of MAC infections is complicated and should be directed by clinicians familiar with mycobacterial diseases; consultation with a specialist is particularly important when the patient cannot tolerate first-line drugs or when the infection has not responded to prior therapy or is caused by macrolide-resistant MAC. Treatment of M. kansasii \u2020 infections in conjunction with other antimycobacterials. ATS and IDSA recommend a multiple-drug regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol for treatment of pulmonary or disseminated infections caused by M. kansasii . If rifampin-resistant M. kansasii are involved, ATS and IDSA recommend a 3-drug regimen based on results of in vitro susceptibility testing, including clarithromycin (or azithromycin), moxifloxacin, ethambutol, sulfamethoxazole, or streptomycin. Consult most recent ATS, CDC, and IDSA recommendations for treatment of other mycobacterial infections for more specific information. Alternative for treatment of nongonococcal urethritis \u2020 (NGU). CDC recommends azithromycin or doxycycline; alternatives are erythromycin, levofloxacin, or ofloxacin. For persistent or recurrent NGU in men compliant with previous treatment who have not been reexposed to an untreated sexual partner(s), CDC recommends that those initially treated with azithromycin be retreated with moxifloxacin.

{"Question": "What are the warnings for Vitamin B12?", "Answer": "Known hypersensitivity to vitamin B 12 , cobalt, or any ingredient in the formulation. No contraindications when used for treatment of cyanide poisoning. Fatal hypokalemia reported in intensively treated patients with megaloblastic anemia. Monitor serum potassium concentrations during early vitamin B 12 therapy and administer potassium if necessary. Vitamin B 12 deficiency may suppress signs of polycythemia vera; treatment may unmask this condition. Avoid use in patients with early Leber\u2019s disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy); rapid and severe optic nerve atrophy reported. Anaphylaxis reported with parenteral preparations. Hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit ): Rash, mainly acneiform, reported in 20 or 44% of individuals receiving a 5- or 10-g dose, respectively. Administer an intradermal test dose prior to administration of vitamin B 12 for vitamin deficiency in patients who may be sensitive to cobalamins. Obtain hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B 12 , folate, and iron levels prior to treatment for vitamin B 12 deficiency. Monitor hematologic parameters as necessary during therapy. Some cyanocobalamin injection preparations contain aluminum, which may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum >4\u20135 mcg/kg daily accumulate aluminum at levels associated with CNS and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. Cyanocobalamin injection may contain benzyl alcohol as a preservative; benzyl alcohol has been associated with toxicity in neonates. (See Pediatric Precautions.) Transient elevations in BP reported in individuals receiving IV hydroxocobalamin. Use extreme caution if folic acid is administered to patients with undiagnosed anemia; may obscure the diagnosis of pernicious anemia by alleviating hematologic manifestations of the disease while allowing neurologic complications to progress. Oxalate crystals observed in the urine of healthy individuals and cyanide poisoning victims following administration of hydroxocobalamin. Category C. Distributed into human milk. Hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit ): Caution advised; no data available to determine when breast-feeding may be restarted following administration of IV hydroxocobalamin. Hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit ): Safety and efficacy not established. Cyanocobalamin: Benzyl alcohol has been associated with toxicity (\u201cgasping syndrome\u201d) in neonates; each mL of cyanocobalamin injection (e.g., preparation manufacturered by Abraxis) contains 15 mg of benzyl alcohol. Hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit ): No substantial differences in safety and efficacy relative to younger adults. Dosage adjustment not needed. Hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit ): Safety and efficacy not studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit ): Safety and efficacy not studied in patients with renal impairment. Hydroxocobalamin and cyanocobalamin excreted unchanged in urine. Usually nontoxic even in large doses; mild transient diarrhea, peripheral vascular thrombosis, itching, transitory exanthema, urticaria, body swelling reported in patients receiving parenteral preparations."}
