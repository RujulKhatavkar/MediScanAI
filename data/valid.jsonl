Nonprescription preparations used for temporary relief of minor skin irritations, itching, and rash caused by eczema, dermatitis, insect bites, poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, soaps, detergents, cosmetics, or jewelry. Nonprescription preparations used for temporary relief of itchy anal and/or genital areas. Nonprescription preparations used for temporary relief of itching and minor scalp irritation caused by scalp dermatitis. Generally most effective in acute or chronic dermatoses (e.g., seborrheic or atopic dermatitis, localized neurodermatitis, anogenital pruritus, psoriasis, late phase of allergic contact dermatitis, inflammatory phase of xerosis). Topical therapy generally preferred over systemic therapy; fewer associated adverse systemic effects. Topical therapy generally only controls manifestations of dermatoses; eliminate cause if possible. Topical efficacy may be increased by using a higher concentration or occlusive dressing therapy. (See Administration with Occlusive Dressing under Dosage and Administration.) Response may vary from one topical corticosteroid preparation to another. Anti-inflammatory activity may vary considerably depending on the vehicle, drug concentration, site of application, disease, and individual patient. Topical treatment of infected dermatoses in combination with topical anti-infectives (e.g., neomycin, polymyxin B) or antifungals. If a topical corticosteroid is used in combination with a topical anti-infective, weigh benefits against risks. (See Skin Infection under Cautions.) Hydrocortisone acetate paste used as an adjunct for temporary symptomatic relief of oral inflammatory or ulcerative lesions resulting from trauma. Used rectally as a retention enema for adjunctive treatment of mild or moderate acute ulcerative colitis limited to the rectosigmoid or left colon. Used rectally as a retention enema for mild acute ulcerative colitis of the transverse or descending colon. Retention enema usually is effective in mild or moderate acute rectosigmoid ulcerative colitis when response to sulfasalazine (generally considered the maintenance drug of choice) is inadequate or when sulfasalazine cannot be given. Systemic corticosteroids and/or corticosteroid enemas are more effective than sulfasalazine in acute ulcerative colitis attacks, but if surgery is required, it should not be delayed in favor of corticosteroid therapy. Hydrocortisone acetate rectal suppositories or suspension (foam), may be effective as adjunctive treatment of rectal ulcerative colitis. Hydrocortisone acetate rectal suppositories also are used in the treatment of other anorectal inflammatory conditions (e.g., inflamed hemorrhoids, postirradiation or factitial proctitis, cryptitis, pruritus ani). Fixed-combination preparations of a corticosteroid and local anesthetic may be useful for symptomatic relief of anorectal conditions (e.g., hemorrhoids), but combinations with antihistamines, astringents, keratolytics, and/or vasoconstrictors are of questionable efficacy."}

{"Question": "What are the warnings for Hydrocortisone (Topical)?", "Answer": "Known hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone or any ingredient in the formulation. Rectal corticosteroid therapy in patients with intestinal obstruction, abscess, impending perforation, peritonitis, extensive fistulas, and fresh intestinal anastomoses or sinus tracts. Allergic contact dermatitis may manifest as failure to heal rather than irritation as occurs with other topical preparations that do not contain corticosteroids; confirm with diagnostic patch testing. Topically applied corticosteroids can be absorbed in sufficient amounts to reversibly suppress the HPA axis. Perform periodic HPA-axis evaluation by appropriate testing (e.g., ACTH stimulation, morning plasma cortisol, urinary free cortisol), especially in patients applying a topical corticosteroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion. If HPA-axis suppression occurs, withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, and/or substitute a less potent corticosteroid. HPA-axis function recovery generally is prompt and complete following drug discontinuance. Rarely, glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may require systemic corticosteroid therapy. Systemic absorption following topical administration may result in manifestations of Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. Adverse systemic effects may occur when corticosteroids are used on large areas of the body, for prolonged periods of time, with an occlusive dressing, and/or concurrently with other corticosteroid-containing preparations. Infants and children may be more susceptible to adverse systemic effects. (See Pediatric Use under Cautions.) Possible adverse local reactions (e.g., irritation, dryness, folliculitis, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, striae, miliaria); may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings, especially with prolonged therapy. Prolonged use of topical corticosteroids may cause atrophy of the epidermis and subcutaneous tissue; these effects are most likely to occur (even with short-term use) in intertriginous (e.g., axilla, groin), flexor, and facial areas. If irritation occurs, discontinue drug and initiate appropriate therapy. If concurrent skin infection is present or develops, initiate appropriate anti-infective therapy. If infection does not respond promptly, discontinue topical corticosteroid therapy until the infection has been controlled. When topical corticosteroids and topical anti-infectives are used concomitantly, consider that the corticosteroid may mask clinical signs of bacterial, fungal, or viral infections; prevent recognition of ineffectiveness of the anti-infective; or suppress hypersensitivity reactions to ingredients in the formulation. In addition, consider the cautions, precautions, and contraindications associated with the anti-infective. Do not use occlusive dressings in patients with primary skin infection. Some manufacturers state that topical corticosteroids are contraindicated in patients with tuberculosis of the skin, dermatologic fungal infections, and cutaneous or systemic viral infection (including vaccinia and varicella and herpes simplex of the eye or adjacent skin); however, most clinicians believe topical corticosteroids may be used with caution if the infection is treated. Use rectally with caution in severe ulcerative disease and only after adequate proctologic examination; risk of intestinal perforation. Adverse systemic corticosteroid effects may occur with use of occlusive dressings on large areas of the body and for prolonged periods of time; monitor accordingly. (See Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Suppression and also Systemic Effects, under Cautions.) Adverse local reactions may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings, especially with prolonged therapy. (See Local Effects under Cautions.) Do not use occlusive dressings on weeping or exudative lesions. Do not use occlusive dressings in patients with primary skin infection. Remove occlusive dressings covering large areas if body temperature increases; thermal homeostasis may be impaired. Use plastic occlusive material with care to avoid the risk of suffocation. When used in fixed combination with other agents, consider the cautions, precautions, and contraindications associated with the concomitant agents. Category C. Not known whether topical hydrocortisone is distributed into milk. Caution advised if topical hydrocortisone is used. Nonprescription hydrocortisone preparations should not be used in children <2 years of age unless directed and supervised by a clinician. Tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants should not be used on a child being treated in the diaper area, since such garments may constitute occlusive dressings. Children are more susceptible to topical corticosteroid-induced HPA-axis suppression and Cushing\u2019s syndrome than mature individuals because of a greater skin surface area-to-body weight ratio, especially when topical corticosteroids are applied to >20% of body surface area. The risk of adrenal suppression appears to increase with decreasing age. (See Systemic Effects under Cautions.) Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol concentrations, and lack of response to corticotropin (ACTH) stimulation. Children also are at greater risk of glucocorticoid insufficiency during and/or after withdrawal of treatment. Intracranial hypertension has occurred in children; manifestations include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Striae has been reported in children treated inappropriately with topical corticosteroids. Topical corticosteroid therapy in children should be limited to the minimum amount necessary for therapeutic efficacy; chronic topical corticosteroid therapy may interfere with growth and development. Burning, stinging, itching, irritation, dry skin, erythema, folliculitis, hypopigmentation, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection."}

{"Question": "What is Erythromycin used for?", "Answer": "Erythromycin belongs to a group of drugs called macrolide antibiotics. Macrolide antibiotics slow the growth of, or sometimes kill, sensitive bacteria by reducing the production of important proteins needed by the bacteria to survive.

{"Question": "What is Fluconazole used for?", "Answer": "Fluconazole is a prescription azole antifungal medication that may be used to treat serious fungal or yeast infections including those that affect the vagina, mouth or throat, lungs, bladder, or blood. It is available as an oral tablet, suspension, or injectable form. Fluconazole may also be used to prevent fungal infections in people with a weak immune system caused by cancer or cancer treatment including radiation therapy, bone marrow transplant, conditions such as AIDS, or children on life support (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]). Fluconazole works by targeting a key enzyme (lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase) responsible for building a crucial cell wall component (ergosterol) in fungi. By blocking this enzyme, Fluconazole prevents the fungus from forming a normal cell wall, leading to the buildup of abnormal sterols. These abnormal sterols weaken the fungal cell wall, hindering its growth. Fluconazole's mechanism of action means it has a much greater effect on this enzyme in fungi compared to the same enzyme in human cells. This selectivity helps minimize side effects. Fluconazole was first FDA approved on January 29, 1990. Brand names for fluconazole include Diflucan and generic fluconazole is available."}

Promacta is also used to increase the number of platelets in people who have hepatitis C (a viral infection that may damage the liver) so that they can begin and continue treatment with interferon (Peginterferon, Pegintron, others) and ribavirin (Rebetol). Promacta is also used in combination with other medications to treat aplastic anemia (condition in which the body does not make enough new blood cells) in adults and children 2 years of age and older. Promacta is also used to treat aplastic anemia in adults who have not been helped with other medications. Promacta is used to increase the number of platelets enough to decrease the risk of bleeding in people with ITP or aplastic anemia, or to allow treatment with interferon and ribavirin in people with hepatitis C. However it is not used to increase the number of platelets to a normal level. Promacta should not be used to treat people who have low numbers of platelets due to conditions other than ITP, hepatitis C, or aplastic anemia. Promacta is not for use in treating myelodysplastic syndrome (also called \"preleukemia\")."}

{"Question": "What is Ozempic used for?", "Answer": "Ozempic is used for type 2 diabetes to improve blood sugar levels and lower the risk of stroke, heart attack , or death for adults with type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Ozempic for weight loss has been shown to be effective in clinical trials. Ozempic is given as a once-weekly injection under the skin of the belly, the thigh, or the upper arm using an autoinjector (pen). Ozempic works by helping the pancreas release more insulin, decreasing the amount of sugar your liver makes, and slowing the rate food passes through your body, making you feel full longer. This helps to lower blood sugar levels and lowers the risk of a major cardiovascular event. Ozempic is a GLP-1 agonist that works the same way as a natural hormone made in our gut called GLP-1. GLP-1 controls insulin release and gut emptying and regulates appetite and food intake. Ozempic works by binding to GLP-1 receptors, which results in lower blood sugar and A1C levels and may also reduce appetite to help with weight loss. Ozempic is FDA-approved to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and to lower the risk of major cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes. It should be used together with diet and exercise. Ozempic ( semaglutide ) should not be used for type 1 diabetes mellitus ."}

{"Question": "What is Tibsovo used for?", "Answer": "Tibsovo (ivosidenib) is a once-daily oral medication that targets a specific gene mutation called the isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutation, which can affect your bone marrow. An IDH1 mutation prevents young blood cells from developing into healthy adult blood cells, which can result in blood and bone marrow disorders such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Tibsovo may be used to treat adults with a confirmed susceptible IDH1 mutation with: Tibsovo targets the IDH1 mutation. In regular cells, the IDH1 gene produces the IDH1 protein, involved in normal cellular chemical processes. However, when the IDH1 gene is modified due to a genetic mutation, it leads to an abnormal version of the IDH1 protein and other substances such as the oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Tibsovo decreases levels of 2-HG, reducing blast counts and increasing levels of mature myeloid cells. Blasts are undeveloped bone marrow cells that will later mature into red blood cells, white blood cells, or blood-clotting platelets. They are typically absent in the bloodstream, and their presence signals a bone marrow issue, such as myelodysplastic syndrome. Up to 20% of people with cholangiocarcinoma, and 6% to 10% of people with AML have the IDH1 mutation. Tibsovo was first FDA-approved on July 20, 2018."}

{"Question": "What is Levaquin used for?", "Answer": "Levaquin is a fluoroquinolone (flor-o-KWIN-o-lone) antibiotic that fights bacteria in the body. Levaquin is used to treat different types of bacterial infections. Levofloxacin is also used to treat people who have been exposed to anthrax or certain types of plague . Fluoroquinolone antibiotics can cause serious or disabling side effects. Levaquin should be used only for infections that cannot be treated with a safer antibiotic."}
{"Question": "What is Phenylephrine used for?", "Answer": "Oral and nasal phenylephrine are used as nasal decongestants to temporarily unblock a nose or relieve sinus pressure in people with nasal and sinus congestion caused by colds, allergies, or hay fever. While phenylephrine can provide some symptom relief, it doesn't treat the underlying cause or speed recovery. Injectable phenylephrine may be used in a hospital setting to increase blood pressure in adults with significantly low blood pressure caused primarily by vasodilation (a widening of the blood vessels), as a result of septic shock or anesthesia. Phenylephrine works by directly stimulating receptors in the blood vessels of the nose and other parts of the body (called alpha-1 adrenergic receptors), causing vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels). This reduces nasal congestion by preventing fluid from draining from the blood vessels into the tissues lining the nasal passages. At higher dosages, phenylephrine increases blood pressure and reduces heart rate and cardiac output (particularly in people with preexisting heart disease). Phenylephrine has been available for over 60 years, which means it wasn't subject to the same rigorous scrutiny by the FDA as newer medicines."}

{"Question": "What are the warnings for Moxifloxacin?", "Answer": "History of hypersensitivity to moxifloxacin or other quinolones. Systemic fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions (e.g., tendinitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, CNS effects) that can occur together in the same patient. May occur within hours to weeks after a systemic fluoroquinolone is initiated; have occurred in all age groups and in patients without preexisting risk factors for such adverse reactions. Immediately discontinue moxifloxacin at first signs or symptoms of any serious adverse reactions. Avoid systemic fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, in patients who have experienced any of the serious adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones. Systemic fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, are associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all age groups. Risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture increased in older adults (usually those >60 years of age), individuals receiving concomitant corticosteroids, and kidney, heart, or lung transplant recipients. (See Geriatric Use under Cautions.) Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones who did not have any risk factors for such adverse reactions. Fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture most frequently involve the Achilles tendon; also reported in the rotator cuff (shoulder), hand, biceps, thumb, and other tendon sites. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur within hours or days after moxifloxacin is initiated or as long as several months after completion of therapy and can occur bilaterally. Immediately discontinue moxifloxacin if pain, swelling, inflammation, or rupture of a tendon occurs. (See Advice to Patients.) Avoid systemic fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or have experienced tendinitis or tendon rupture. Systemic fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, are associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias, and weakness reported with fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin. Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of the drug and, in some patients, may be irreversible. Immediately discontinue moxifloxacin if symptoms of peripheral neuropathy (e.g., pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness) occur or if there are other alterations in sensations (e.g., light touch, pain, temperature, position sense, vibratory sensation). Avoid systemic fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, in patients who have experienced peripheral neuropathy. Systemic fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, are associated with increased risk of psychiatric adverse effects, including toxic psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, depression, suicidal thoughts or acts, agitation, nervousness, confusion, delirium, disorientation, disturbances in attention, insomnia, nightmares, and memory impairment. These adverse effects may occur after first dose. Systemic fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, are associated with increased risk of seizures (convulsions), increased intracranial pressure (including pseudotumor cerebri), dizziness, and tremors. These CNS effects may occur after first dose. Use with caution in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders (e.g., severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, epilepsy) or other risk factors that predispose to seizures or lower seizure threshold. If psychiatric or other CNS effects occur, immediately discontinue moxifloxacin and institute appropriate measures. (See Advice to Patients.) Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in myasthenia gravis patients; death or need for ventilatory support reported. Avoid use in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis. (See Advice to Patients.) Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity and/or anaphylactic reactions reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin. Although generally reported after multiple doses, these reactions may occur with first dose. Some hypersensitivity reactions have been accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, tingling, edema (pharyngeal or facial), dyspnea, urticaria, or pruritus. Other serious and sometimes fatal adverse reactions reported with fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, that may or may not be related to hypersensitivity reactions include one or more of the following: fever, rash or other severe dermatologic reactions (e.g., toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome); vasculitis, arthralgia, myalgia, serum sickness; allergic pneumonitis; interstitial nephritis, acute renal insufficiency or failure; hepatitis, jaundice, acute hepatic necrosis or failure; anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia (including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura), leukopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and/or other hematologic effects. Immediately discontinue moxifloxacin at first appearance of rash, jaundice, or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Institute appropriate therapy as indicated (e.g., epinephrine, corticosteroids, maintenance of an adequate airway and oxygen). Moderate to severe photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions reported with fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin. Phototoxicity may manifest as exaggerated sunburn reactions (e.g., burning, erythema, exudation, vesicles, blistering, edema) on areas exposed to sun or artificial ultraviolet (UV) light (usually the face, neck, extensor surfaces of forearms, dorsa of hands). Avoid unnecessary or excessive exposure to sunlight or artificial UV light (tanning beds, UVA/UVB treatment) while receiving moxifloxacin. If patient needs to be outdoors, they should wear loose-fitting clothing that protects skin from sun exposure and use other sun protection measures (sunscreen). Discontinue moxifloxacin if photosensitivity or phototoxicity (sunburn-like reaction, skin eruption) occurs. Prolonged QT interval leading to ventricular arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes, reported with some fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin. Do not exceed usual recommended dosage or IV infusion rate since this may increase risk of prolonged QT interval. Avoid use in patients with known prolonged QT interval, ventricular arrhythmias (including torsades de pointes), any ongoing proarrhythmic conditions (including clinically important bradycardia and acute myocardial ischemia), or uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. Avoid use in patients receiving class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents or other drugs that prolong QT interval (e.g., cisapride [available in the US only under a limited-access protocol], erythromycin, antipsychotic agents, tricyclic antidepressants). (See Drugs that Prolong QT Interval under Interactions.) Risk of QT interval prolongation may be increased in geriatric patients. (See Geriatric Use under Cautions.) Use with caution in patients with mild, moderate, or severe liver cirrhosis. (See Hepatic Impairment under Cautions.) Rupture or dissection of aortic aneurysms reported in patients receiving systemic fluoroquinolones. Epidemiologic studies indicate an increased risk of aortic aneurysm and dissection within 2 months following use of systemic fluoroquinolones, particularly in geriatric patients. Cause for this increased risk not identified. Unless there are no other treatment options, do not use systemic fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, in patients who have an aortic aneurysm or are at increased risk for an aortic aneurysm. This includes geriatric patients and patients with peripheral atherosclerotic vascular disease, hypertension, or certain genetic conditions (e.g., Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome). If patient reports adverse effects suggestive of aortic aneurysm or dissection, immediately discontinue the fluoroquinolone. (See Advice to Patients.) Systemic fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, are associated with alterations in blood glucose concentrations, including symptomatic hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Blood glucose disturbances during fluoroquinolone therapy usually have occurred in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving an oral antidiabetic agent (e.g., glyburide) or insulin. Severe cases of hypoglycemia resulting in coma or death reported with some systemic fluoroquinolones. Although most reported cases of hypoglycemic coma involved patients with risk factors for hypoglycemia (e.g., older age, diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, concomitant use of antidiabetic agents [especially sulfonylureas]), some involved patients receiving a fluoroquinolone who were not diabetic and not receiving an oral antidiabetic agent or insulin. Carefully monitor blood glucose concentrations when moxifloxacin used in diabetic patients receiving antidiabetic agents. If a hypoglycemic reaction occurs, discontinue the fluoroquinolone and initiate appropriate therapy immediately. (See Advice to Patients.) Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, cause arthropathy and osteochondrosis in immature animals of various species. Permanent lesions in cartilage reported in moxifloxacin studies in immature dogs. Safety and efficacy not established in children and adolescents <18 years of age (see Pediatric Use under Cautions) or in pregnant or lactating women (see Pregnancy and see Lactation under Cautions). Treatment with anti-infectives alters normal colon flora and may permit overgrowth of Clostridioides difficile (formerly known as Clostridium difficile ). C. difficile infection (CDI) and C. difficile -associated diarrhea and colitis (CDAD; also known as antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis or pseudomembranous colitis) reported with nearly all anti-infectives, including moxifloxacin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to development of CDAD; hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile are associated with increased morbidity and mortality since they may be refractory to anti-infectives and colectomy may be required. Consider CDAD if diarrhea develops and manage accordingly. Careful medical history necessary since CDAD may occur as late as 2 months or longer after anti-infective therapy is discontinued. If CDAD suspected or confirmed, discontinue anti-infectives not directed against C. difficile as soon as possible. Initiate appropriate anti-infective therapy directed against C. difficile (e.g., vancomycin, fidaxomicin, metronidazole), supportive therapy (e.g., fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation), and surgical evaluation as clinically indicated. Use for treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis or acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis only when no other treatment options available. Because moxifloxacin, like other systemic fluoroquinolones, has been associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions (e.g., tendinitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, CNS effects) that can occur together in the same patient, risks of serious adverse reactions outweigh benefits for patients with these infections. To reduce development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of moxifloxacin and other antibacterials, use only for treatment or prevention of infections proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When selecting or modifying anti-infective therapy, use results of culture and in vitro susceptibility testing. In the absence of such data, consider local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns when selecting anti-infectives for empiric therapy. Information on test methods and quality control standards for in vitro susceptibility testing of antibacterial agents and specific interpretive criteria for such testing recognized by FDA is available at [Web] . Human data for moxifloxacin insufficient to inform any drug-associated risk regarding use during pregnancy. Based on animal studies, moxifloxacin may cause fetal harm. Not teratogenic in pregnant rats, rabbits, and monkeys at exposures up to 2.5 times higher than human exposures reported with usual dosage, but embryofetal toxicity (e.g., decreased neonatal body weights, increased incidence of skeletal variations [rib and vertebra combined], increased fetal loss) observed in pregnant rats or rabbits at dosages associated with maternal toxicity. Advise pregnant women of potential risk to fetus. Not known whether distributed into human milk; distributed into milk in rats. Consider developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding along with the mother's clinical need for moxifloxacin; also consider potential adverse effects on breast-fed infant from the drug or underlying maternal condition. Efficacy not established for any indication in children or adolescents <18 years of age. Limited data available from a clinical study in pediatric patients \u22653 months of age indicate overall safety profile of the drug in pediatric patients is comparable to that reported in adults. Like other fluoroquinolones, moxifloxacin causes arthropathy in juvenile animals. (See Musculoskeletal Effects under Cautions.) AAP states use of a systemic fluoroquinolone may be justified in children <18 years of age in certain specific circumstances when there are no safe and effective alternatives and the drug is known to be effective. No overall differences in safety or efficacy relative to younger adults. Risk of severe tendon disorders, including tendon rupture, is increased in older adults (usually those >60 years of age). This risk is further increased in those receiving concomitant corticosteroids. (See Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture under Cautions.) Use caution in geriatric adults, especially those receiving concomitant corticosteroids. Risk of QT interval prolongation may be increased in geriatric patients. (See Prolongation of QT Interval under Cautions.) Risk of aortic aneurysm and dissection may be increased in geriatric patients. (See Risk of Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection under Cautions.) Dosage adjustments not necessary in adults with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A, B, or C). Use with caution in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment; monitor ECGs in those with liver cirrhosis. Metabolic disturbances associated with hepatic insufficiency may lead to QT interval prolongation. Dosage adjustments not necessary in adults with renal impairment. GI effects (nausea, diarrhea), headache, dizziness."}

{"Question": "What is Jardiance used for?", "Answer": "Jardiance (empagliflozin) is an FDA-approved tablet used to help control blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes and is also used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems in adults with heart failure or cardiovascular disease with type 2 diabetes.

Jardiance should be used together with diet and exercise when prescribed for type 2 diabetes. Jardiance 10mg tablets are also used for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults that have risk of disease prgression. In CKD Jardiance is used to reduce the risk of sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death and hospitalization. Jardiance is from the class of medicines called SGLT-2 inhibitors (sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors).\u00a0 Jardiance works for type 2 diabetes by blocking SGLT-2 proteins located in the renal tubules of the kidneys, which are responsible for reabsorbing glucose back into the bloodstream. The way Jardiance works to reduce the risk of cardiovascular or heart failure is thought to be related to changes in heart muscle metabolism from favoring the use of glucose to using a more balanced combination of fatty acids, ketone bodies (ketone), branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and glucose. Jardiance also improves the heart's diastolic stiffness and diastolic function. Type 2 diabetes is a long-term condition when your blood sugars (HbA1c) become too high because the body does not produce or use insulin normally.\u00a0 Over time high blood sugar can cause serious health problems, including heart disease , vision loss , and kidney disease.

{"Question": "What is Avsola used for?", "Answer": "Avsola (infliximab-axxq) is a monoclonal antibody drug used to treat certain inflammatory autoimmune diseases. Avsola is a biological drug and one of four biosimilars of Remicade (infliximab). Biosimilars are highly similar versions of a drug that are designed to have the same effect, but they are not identical to the original version of the drug. Avsola works the same as other versions of infliximab and blocks the damage caused by too much tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Avsola binds to TNF-alpha, which prevents it from interacting with its receptors and activating certain processes in your body. TNF-alpha is a protein and inflammatory cytokine produced by your body, which plays an important role in your normal immune response. It is involved in your inflammatory response, and helps to fight off infection and cancer. Some people produce too much TNF-alpha, however, and this can cause an autoimmune disease to develop. Avsola was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2019, more than 20 years after the original version of infliximab - Remicade - was approved."}

It may also be given to treat adults with the following conditions under the accelerated approval scheme; continued approval may be contingent upon clinical trial results: Brukinsa directly inhibits an enzyme, called Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK), by forming a covalent bond with a cysteine residue on the enzyme, preventing its activity. BTK works as a signaling molecule for the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. Activation of these pathways causes the proliferation of B cells and other interactions, and inhibition has been shown to reduce the growth and spread of malignant B cells. The ALPINE trial -- the first head-to-head phase 3 comparison trial of Brukinsa versus Imbruvica to be conducted -- reported Brukinsa was more effective than Imbruvica for progression-free survival in previously treated patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. Brukinsa also demonstrated a favorable cardiac safety profile with significantly lower rates of atrial fibrillation/flutter (5.2% vs. 13.3%) and no deaths due to cardiac disorders (vs 1.9% deaths with Imbruvica).

When anti-infectives indicated, AAP recommends high-dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin and clavulanate as drugs of choice for initial treatment of AOM; certain cephalosporins (cefdinir, cefpodoxime, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone) recommended as alternatives for initial treatment in penicillin-allergic patients without a history of severe and/or recent penicillin-allergic reactions. Treatment of pharyngitis and tonsillitis caused by S. pyogenes (group A \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci). Generally effective in eradicating S. pyogenes from nasopharynx; efficacy in prevention of subsequent rheumatic fever not established. AAP, IDSA, AHA, and others recommend a penicillin regimen (10 days of oral penicillin V or oral amoxicillin or single dose of IM penicillin G benzathine) as treatments of choice for S. pyogenes pharyngitis and tonsillitis; other anti-infectives (oral cephalosporins, oral macrolides, oral clindamycin) recommended as alternatives in penicillin-allergic patients. If an oral cephalosporin used, 10 day regimen of first generation cephalosporin (cefadroxil, cephalexin) preferred instead of other cephalosporins with broader spectrums of activity (e.g., cefaclor, cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefuroxime).

Not a drug of choice for meningitis; treatment failures have been reported, especially in meningitis caused by H. influenzae . In addition, bacteriologic response to cefuroxime appears to be slower than that reported with ceftriaxone, which may increase the risk for hearing loss and neurologic sequelae. When a cephalosporin is indicated for the treatment of bacterial meningitis, a parenteral third generation cephalosporin (usually ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) generally recommended. Treatment of acute maxillary sinusitis caused by susceptible S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae (non-\u03b2-lactamase-producing strains only). Data insufficient to date to establish efficacy for treatment of acute maxillary sinusitis known or suspected to be caused by \u03b2-lactamase-producing strains of H. influenzae or M. catarrhalis . Because of variable activity against S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae , IDSA no longer recommends second or third generation oral cephalosporins for empiric monotherapy of acute bacterial sinusitis. Oral amoxicillin or amoxicillin and clavulanate usually recommended for empiric treatment. If an oral cephalosporin used as an alternative in children (e.g., in penicillin-allergic individuals), combination regimen that includes a third generation cephalosporin (cefixime or cefpodoxime) and clindamycin (or linezolid) recommended. Treatment of secondary bacterial infections of acute bronchitis caused by susceptible S. pneumoniae , H. influenzae (non-\u03b2-lactamase-producing strains only), or H. parainfluenzae (non-\u03b2-lactamase-producing strains only). Treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis caused by susceptible S. pneumoniae , H. influenzae (non-\u03b2-lactamase-producing strains only), or H. parainfluenzae (non-\u03b2-lactamase-producing strains only). Parenteral treatment of lower respiratory tract infections (including pneumonia) caused by susceptible S. pneumoniae , S. aureus (including penicillinase-producing strains), S. pyogenes (group A \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci), H. influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Escherichia coli , or Klebsiella . Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Recommended by ATS and IDSA as an alternative for treatment of CAP caused by penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae . Also recommended as an alternative in certain combination regimens used for empiric treatment of CAP. Select regimen for empiric treatment of CAP based on most likely pathogens and local susceptibility patterns; after pathogen is identified, modify to provide more specific therapy (pathogen-directed therapy). For empiric outpatient treatment of CAP when risk factors for drug-resistant S. pneumoniae are present (e.g., comorbidities such as chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease, diabetes, alcoholism, malignancies, asplenia, immunosuppression; use of anti-infectives within the last 3 months), ATS and IDSA recommend monotherapy with a fluoroquinolone active against S. pneumoniae (moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin) or, alternatively, a combination regimen that includes a \u03b2-lactam active against S. pneumoniae (high-dose amoxicillin or fixed combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid or, alternatively, ceftriaxone, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime) given in conjunction with a macrolide (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin) or doxycycline. Cefuroxime and cefpodoxime may be less active against S. pneumoniae than amoxicillin or ceftriaxone. If a parenteral cephalosporin is used as an alternative to penicillin G or amoxicillin for treatment of CAP caused by penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae , ATS and IDSA recommend ceftriaxone, cefotaxime or cefuroxime; if an oral cephalosporin is used for treatment of these infections, ATS and IDSA recommend cefpodoxime, cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefdinir, or cefditoren. Parenteral treatment of septicemia caused by susceptible S. aureus (including penicillinase-producing strains), S. pneumoniae , E. coli , H. influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), or Klebsiella . In the treatment of known or suspected sepsis or the treatment of other serious infections when the causative organism is unknown, concomitant therapy with an aminoglycoside may be indicated pending results of in vitro susceptibility tests. Oral treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by susceptible S. aureus (including \u03b2-lactamase-producing strains) or S. pyogenes . Parenteral treatment of skin and skin structure infections caused by susceptible S. aureus (including \u03b2-lactamase-producing strains), S. pyogenes , E. coli , Klebsiella , or Enterobacter . Oral treatment of uncomplicated UTIs caused by susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae . Parenteral treatment of UTIs caused by susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae . Has been used orally or parenterally for treatment of uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal gonorrhea caused by susceptible Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Has been used parenterally for treatment of disseminated gonococcal infections caused by susceptible N. gonorrhoeae . Not included in current CDC recommendations for gonococcal infections. Because of concerns related to recent reports of N. gonorrhoeae with reduced susceptibility to cephalosporins, CDC states that oral cephalosporins no longer recommended as first-line treatment for uncomplicated gonorrhea. For treatment of uncomplicated urogenital, anorectal, or pharyngeal gonorrhea, CDC recommends a combination regimen that includes a single dose of IM ceftriaxone and either a single dose of oral azithromycin or 7-day regimen of oral doxycycline. Treatment of early Lyme disease manifested as erythema migrans. IDSA, AAP, and other clinicians recommend oral doxycycline, oral amoxicillin, or oral cefuroxime axetil as first-line therapy for treatment of early localized or early disseminated Lyme disease associated with erythema migrans, in the absence of specific neurologic involvement or advanced atrioventricular (AV) heart block. Treatment of early neurologic Lyme disease \u2020 [off-label] in patients with cranial nerve palsy alone without evidence of meningitis (i.e., those with normal CSF examinations or those for whom CSF examination is deemed unnecessary because there are no clinical signs of meningitis). Parenteral anti-infectives (IV ceftriaxone, IV penicillin G sodium, or IV cefotaxime) recommended for treatment of early Lyme disease when there are acute neurologic manifestations such as meningitis or radiculopathy. Treatment of Lyme carditis \u2020 [off-label] . IDSA and others state that patients with AV heart block and/or myopericarditis associated with early Lyme disease may be treated with an oral regimen (doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil) or a parenteral regimen (IV ceftriaxone or, alternatively, IV cefotaxime or IV penicillin G sodium). A parenteral regimen usually recommended for initial treatment of hospitalized patients; an oral regimen can be used to complete therapy and for the treatment of outpatients. Treatment of borrelial lymphocytoma \u2020 [off-label] . Although experience is limited, IDSA states that available data indicate that borrelial lymphocytoma may be treated with an oral regimen (doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil). Treatment of uncomplicated Lyme arthritis \u2020 [off-label] without clinical evidence of neurologic disease. An oral regimen (doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil) can be used, but a parenteral regimen (IV ceftriaxone or, alternatively, IV cefotaxime or IV penicillin G sodium) should be used in those with Lyme arthritis and concomitant neurologic disease. Patients with persistent or recurrent joint swelling after a recommended oral regimen should receive retreatment with the oral regimen or a switch to a parenteral regimen. Some clinicians prefer retreatment with an oral regimen for those whose arthritis substantively improved but did not completely resolve; these clinicians reserve parenteral regimens for those patients whose arthritis failed to improve or worsened. Allow several months for joint inflammation to resolve after initial treatment before an additional course of anti-infectives is given. Perioperative prophylaxis in patients undergoing cardiac surgery; a drug of choice for cardiac procedures (e.g., coronary artery bypass, pacemaker or other cardiac device insertion, ventricular assist devices). Perioperative prophylaxis in patients undergoing clean head and neck surgery involving placement of prosthesis (excluding tympanostomy); perioperative prophylaxis in conjunction with metronidazole in patients undergoing clean-contaminated cancer surgery of the head and neck or other clean-contaminated head and neck procedures (excluding tonsillectomy and functional endoscopic sinus procedures). A drug of choice. Has been used for perioperative prophylaxis in patients undergoing noncardiac thoracic surgery, GI or biliary tract surgery, gynecologic or obstetric surgery (e.g., vaginal hysterectomy), orthopedic procedures, or heart transplantation. Other anti-infectives (e.g., cefazolin) usually preferred."}

{"Question": "What is Renflexis used for?", "Answer": "Renflexis (infliximab-abda) is a monocloncal antibody used to treat a range of inflammatory autoimmune diseases. Renflexis is a biological drug and one of four biosimilars of Remicade (infliximab). Biosimilar of Remicade are highly similar versions of the drug, which are designed to have the same effect, but which are not identical. Renflexis works in the same way as the other versions of infliximab, by blocking the damage that results from too much tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Renflexis binds to TNF-alpha, which stops it from interacting with its receptors and activating certain processes. TNF-alpha is a protein and inflammatory cytokine which plays a key role in your normal immune response. It is involved in your inflammatory response and also helps to fight off infection and cancer. Some people, however, produce too much TNF-alpha and this can cause an autoimmune disease to develop. Renflexis was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017, almost 20 years after the original version of infliximab started being used."}
