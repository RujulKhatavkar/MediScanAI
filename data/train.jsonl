{"Question": "What is Olumiant used for?", "Answer": "Olumiant (baricitinib) tablets are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis , \u00a0severe alopecia areata (hair loss) and COVID-19 in certain patients. These conditions may be caused by an overactive immune system causing inflammation. Olumiant works by blocking a specific protein (Janus kinase) that causes inflammation to help relieve the symptoms of these conditions. Olumiant is classified as a Janus kinase inhibitor (JAK inhibitor). In rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system attacks healthy joint tissues causing the joint to be inflamed. Olumiant reduces inflammation in RA to help relieve pain, swelling, and tenderness of the joints. In alopecia areata (AA), hair loss is caused by the immune system attacking the hair follicles, causing inflammation that interrupts hair growth. Olumiant blocks inflammation, which allows hair to regrow. Olumiant treats symptoms of alopecia areata, but it is not a cure, and if you stop taking the tablets, then your hair may fall out again. When used to treat COVID-19, Olumiant is associated with an improvement in COVID-19 symptoms and a reduced need for ventilators. While generally well-tolerated, some patients developed elevated liver enzymes as a side effect. Olumiant gained FDA approval on May 31, 2018.

{"Question": "What are the warnings for Epinephrine?", "Answer": "No absolute contraindications to use in life-threatening conditions. Relative contraindications include shock (other than anaphylactic and septic shock), known hypersensitivity to sympathomimetic amines, coronary insufficiency, or cardiac dilatation, as well as use in most patients with angle-closure glaucoma, or organic brain damage. Contraindicated for use during general anesthesia with agents such as cyclopropane and halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics (e.g., halothane). Contraindicated in conjunction with local anesthetics for use in certain areas (e.g.,fingers, toes, ears). Inadvertent induction of high arterial BP with epinephrine can cause angina pectoris, aortic rupture, or cerebral hemorrhage. Vasopressor therapy is not a substitute for replacement of blood, plasma, fluids, and/or electrolytes. Correct blood volume depletion as fully as possible before epinephrine administration. Avoid extravasation; severe local adverse effects (e.g., tissue necrosis) may occur as a result of local vasoconstriction. Check site of infusion frequently for free flow and observe infused vein for blanching. Avoid injection into leg veins, especially in geriatric patients or those with occlusive vascular diseases (e.g., arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, Buerger\u2019s disease, diabetic endarteritis). If blanching is observed in the infused vein, changing the injection site periodically may be advisable. If extravasation occurs, infiltrate affected area liberally with 10\u201315 mL of sodium chloride solution containing 5\u201310 mg of phentolamine mesylate. Immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes occur if area is infiltrated within 12 hours; therefore, administer phentolamine as soon as possible after extravasation noted. Adverse reactions most likely to occur in hypertensive or hyperthyroid patients; use with extreme caution, if at all. Use with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus, pheochromocytoma, cardiovascular disease, or psychoneurotic disorders. Can induce serious cardiac arrhythmias in patients without heart disease, in those with organic heart disease, and in those with drug-induced myocardial sensitization. Can convert asystole to VF in anesthetic cardiac accidents since many anesthetics sensitize the myocardium to epinephrine. Cyclopropane or halogenated hydrocarbon general anesthetics that increase cardiac irritability and seem to sensitize the myocardium to epinephrine may cause arrhythmias including VPC, VT, or VF. (See Contraindications under Cautions.) Some formulations contain sulfites, which may cause allergic-type reactions (including anaphylaxis and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes) in certain susceptible individuals. Presence of sulfites in a parenteral epinephrine preparation and the possibility of allergic-type reactions should not deter use of the drug when indicated for the treatment of serious allergic reactions or for other emergency situations. Epinephrine is the preferred treatment for such conditions, and currently available alternatives to epinephrine may not be optimally effective. Consider that sulfites may be responsible for paradoxical worsening of respiratory function in asthmatics or for worsening symptoms or decreased bronchodilatory response with increasing use of the drug. Caution in those with a history of sensitivity to sympathomimetic amines. Can cause VF, but beneficial effects in restoring electrical activity and enhancing defibrillation are well documented. May cause tachycardia, ventricular ectopy, tachyarrhythmias, hypertension, and vasoconstriction in patients with a perfusing rhythm. Caution in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, organic heart disease). Extreme caution in patients with prefibrillatory rhythm because of excitatory cardiac activity. Overdosage or inadvertent IV administration may cause cerebrovascular hemorrhage secondary to a marked increase in BP. Caution in patients with long-standing bronchial asthma and substantial emphysema who may also have degenerative heart disease. Can cause pulmonary edema secondary to peripheral vasoconstriction and cardiac stimulation. May decrease vascular vasopressor response. Use vasopressors cautiously with MAO inhibitors. Category C. Use during pregnancy only if clearly indicated. Some manufacturers state that epinephrine injection should be avoided during the second stage of labor or when maternal BP is >130/80 mm Hg. When administered in ACLS, may decrease blood flow to the uterus; however, the woman must be resuscitated for survival of the fetus. Risk unknown. Used in pediatric patients of all ages, dosing according to body weight. Use with caution. Fear, anxiety, tenseness, restlessness, headache, tremor, dizziness, lightheadedness, nervousness, sleeplessness, excitability, and weakness. Increased rigidity and tremor in patients with parkinsonian syndrome. May aggravate or induce psychomotor agitation, disorientation, impaired memory, assaultive behavior, panic, hallucinations, suicidal or homicidal tendencies, and psychosis characterized by clear consciousness with schizophrenic-like thought disorder and paranoid delusions. Nausea, vomiting, sweating, pallor, respiratory difficulty, or respiratory weakness and apnea. ECG changes including a decrease in T-wave amplitude in all leads in normal individuals. Disturbances of cardiac rhythm and rate may result in palpitation and tachycardia. Aggravation or precipitation of angina pectoris by increasing cardiac work and accentuating the insufficiency of the coronary circulation.

{"Question": "What are the warnings for Nitroglycerin?", "Answer": "Known hypersensitivity to nitroglycerin, other nitrates or nitrites, or any ingredient in the formulation. Use of topical nitroglycerin (transdermal system) in those allergic to adhesives used in the system. Use of sublingual nitroglycerin tablets in patients with early MI, severe anemia, or increased intracranial pressure. Use of extended-release oral nitrate preparations in patients with functional or organic GI hypermotility or malabsorption syndrome. Concomitant use of selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil). (See Selective Phosphodiesterase (PDE) Inhibitors under Cautions) Concomitant use of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators (e.g., riociguat). (See Concomitant Use with sGC Stimulators under Cautions.) Selective PDE type 5 inhibitors can potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates and nitrites, possibly resulting in potentially life-threatening hypotension and/or hemodynamic compromise. PDE type 5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) are contraindicated in patients receiving organic nitrates or nitrites in any form (e.g., orally, sublingually, transmucosally, parenterally), given regularly or intermittently, or nitric oxide donors since severe, potentially fatal hypotensive episodes can occur. Clinicians unfamiliar with their patients\u2019 drug history, especially those involved in emergency care (e.g., for presumed MI or ischemia), should take a careful history so that concomitant use of organic nitrates or nitrites with selective PDE inhibitors can be avoided. Warn all patients receiving organic nitrates or nitrites about the potential interaction between the drugs and selective PDE inhibitors, even if they currently are not receiving the drugs, since there is substantial potential for patients to receive the drugs from another clinician, from a friend, with little or no clinical intervention (e.g., via the Internet), or illicitly. Warn all patients taking either selective PDE inhibitors or organic nitrates or nitrites of the potential consequences of taking the drugs within close proximity (e.g., within 24 hours of sildenafil; possibly more prolonged periods of risk with longer-acting PDE inhibitors) of taking a nitrate- or nitrite-containing preparation. Concomitant use of nitrates (e.g., nitroglycerin) or nitrites (e.g., amyl nitrite) with a sGC stimulator (e.g., riociguat) can cause additive hypotensive effects. Such concomitant use is contraindicated. Time course and dose dependence of this interaction not established; use of these drugs within a few days of one another not recommended. Severe hypotension, particularly in upright position, can occur even with low nitroglycerin doses, particularly in the elderly. Use with caution in patients who are volume depleted or have preexisting hypotension. Paradoxical bradycardia and angina exacerbation may accompany hypotension. Benefits in acute MI and CHF not established. If used in these conditions, careful clinical or hemodynamic monitoring for possible hypotension or tachycardia is recommended. Avoid long-acting dosage forms in the early management of acute MI or CHF since the effects are difficult to terminate rapidly should excessive hypotension or tachycardia occur. Allergic reactions reported rarely. Contact dermatitis or fixed drug eruptions reported in patients receiving nitroglycerin ointment or transdermal system. Anaphylactoid reaction reported; possibly may occur with any route. Tolerance to the vascular and antianginal effects of individual nitrates and cross-tolerance among the drugs may occur with repeated, prolonged use. Carefully individualize nitrate dosage to minimize the risk of tolerance; also consider potential risks of nitrate withdrawal. Intermittent dosing of nitrates (e.g., use of a nitrate-free interval of 10\u201314 hours daily) has been used in an attempt to minimize or prevent the development of tolerance to the hemodynamic and antianginal effects of the drugs. Consider the possibility of increased frequency or severity of angina during the nitrate-free interval. Possible cross-tolerance to sublingual nitroglycerin during long-term nitrate use. Nitrate dependence is possible (documented in daily industrial exposures); withdrawal manifestations (e.g., ischemic symptoms, MI, sudden death) can occur. Sublingual tablets: Category B. Sublingual nitroglycerin has been used for the treatment of angina during pregnancy without fetal harm. Lingual aerosol, lingual solution, ointment, transdermal system: Category C. Extended-release capsules, injection, sublingual powder: Data regarding pregnancy lacking. Some experts state that use of nitroglycerin during pregnancy does not appear to present a risk to the fetus; however, experience with the drug in pregnant women is limited. Use during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Not known whether nitroglycerin is distributed into milk. The low molecular weight of nitroglycerin suggests that some distribution into milk may occur. Caution if used in nursing women. Safety and efficacy not established in pediatric patients. Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of individuals \u226565 years of age to determine whether they respond different than younger adults. Severe hypotension, particularly in upright position, can occur even with low nitroglycerin doses, particularly in the elderly. Geriatric patients may be more susceptible to hypotension and may be at greater risk of falling. Use with caution in geriatric patients who may be volume-depleted, are on multiple medications, or who, for whatever reason, already are hypotensive. May aggravate angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, particularly in the elderly. Cautious dosage selection, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, because of possible age-related decreases in hepatic, renal, and/or cardiac function and concomitant disease and drug therapy. Headache (pulsating or throbbing sensation, potentially severe); hypotension (may cause dizziness, weakness, other signs of cerebral ischemia); cutaneous vasodilation with transient flushing."}

{"Question": "What is Aubagio used for?", "Answer": "Aubagio is used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis in adults (including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease). Aubagio may help reduce the relapse rate, slow disability progression, and also slow lesion size growth, compared to placebo treatment. Aubagio tablets are taken once daily with or without food. Aubagio affects the immune system and reduces swelling and inflammation in the nervous system. Aubagio works by lowering the number of lymphocytes that cause inflammation and damage to the nerves. This helps to slow the progression of RRMS and reduce the relapse rate. In RRMS, a type of white blood cell called lymphocytes mistakenly attacks the protective coating (myelin) that surrounds your neurons, which causes inflammation of the neurons and loss of myelin. The neurons are unable to work properly, causing the symptoms of RRMS. Aubagio is not a cure for MS; it helps slow disease progression and reduces relapse rate. Aubagio received FDA approval on September 12, 2012. The generic for Aubagio is called teriflunomide and is also now available."}

{"Question": "What are the warnings for Sodium Chloride?", "Answer": "When administration of sodium or chloride could be clinically detrimental. Bacteriostatic sodium chloride injection: Contraindicated in neonates. (See Pediatric Use under Cautions.) 3 and 5% sodium chloride injections: Presence of increased, normal, or only slightly decreased serum electrolyte concentrations. Thermoject 0.9% injection: Not for injection by the usual parenteral routes of infusion, including infusion through IV administration sets. 14.6% sodium chloride injection: Hypernatremia or fluid retention. Avoid use during and immediately following surgery, unless factors producing salt depletion are present. Because of renal retention of salt during surgery, administration of additional electrolyte may result in fluid retention, edema, and circulatory overload. Monitor for signs of postoperative salt intolerance (e.g., cellular dehydration, weakness, disorientation, anorexia, nausea, distention, deep respiration, oliguria, increased BUN). See ionic concentration and osmolarity tables under Dosage and Administration for specific sodium content information. Risk of sodium retention; use caution when administering solutions containing sodium to patients with hypervolemia, urinary tract obstruction, impending or frank cardiac decompensation, or renal or cardiovascular insufficiency (with or without CHF); to geriatric patients; or in clinical states with sodium retention with edema. (See Specific Populations under Cautions.) Some preparations contain aluminum; may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired, including in premature neonates. If such patients receive parenteral aluminum in amounts of >4\u20135 mcg/kg daily, aluminum may accumulate to levels associated with CNS and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. (See Pediatric Use under Cautions.) Infusion site and other reactions (e.g., fever, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis, hypervolemia, extravasation, phlebitis extending from the site of injection) possible. May occur because of the solution (e.g., contamination) or administration technique. Symptoms may result from excess or deficit of 1 or more ions in the solution; monitor electrolyte concentrations frequently. (See Electrolyte Disturbances under Cautions.) 3 and 5% sodium chloride injections are strongly hypertonic; may cause local pain or venous irritation or damage. (See IV Administration under Dosage and Administration.) If adverse effects occur, discontinue infusion; evaluate patient and institute appropriate therapeutic measures; save remainder of fluid for examination, if necessary. Possible fluid and/or solute overload following IV administration resulting in dilution of serum electrolytes, overhydration, congestive conditions, or pulmonary edema. Infuse 3 and 5% solutions slowly with constant observation of patient to avoid pulmonary edema. Risk of dilutional conditions is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentration administered. Risk of solute overload and resultant congestive conditions with peripheral and/or pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentration administered. Risk of benzyl alcohol toxicity in neonates with use of preparations containing benzyl alcohol. (See Pediatric Use under Cautions.) As patient's condition warrants and during prolonged therapy, evaluate changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance, both clinically and via laboratory determinations. May require additional electrolyte supplements or other appropriate therapy. Possible hypokalemia with excessive or prolonged administration of potassium-free solutions. Possible hypernatremia with excessive IV administration of sodium chloride. Hypernatremia may be associated with edema and exacerbation of CHF secondary to the retention of water. Risk of sudden hypernatremia and complications (e.g., cardiovascular shock, CNS disorders, extensive hemolysis, cortical necrosis of the kidneys) from inadvertent direct injection or absorption of a concentrated sodium chloride solution. Dilute hypertonic solutions prior to administration. (See Dilution under Dosage and Administration.) If infused in large amounts, chloride ions may cause a loss of bicarbonate ions, resulting in an acidifying effect. Patients with substantial electrolyte losses (e.g., resulting from protracted nasogastric suctioning, vomiting, diarrhea, or GI fistula drainage) may require additional electrolyte supplementation. Category C. Not known if sodium chloride is distributed into human milk. Caution if used in nursing women. Safety and efficacy of sodium chloride injection not established; however, the use of sodium chloride solutions in pediatric patients is referenced in medical literature. Use with caution in neonates and small infants; the volume of fluid may affect fluid and electrolyte balance. Some preparations contain aluminum, which may be toxic in premature neonates and in individuals with impaired kidney function. Premature neonates are at particular risk because of immature kidneys and because they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. (See Aluminum Content under Cautions.) Bacteriostatic sodium chloride injection containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative (antimicrobial agent) should not be used for diluting or reconstituting drugs for administration in neonates, nor to flush intravascular catheters in neonates. Large amounts of benzyl alcohol (i.e., 100\u2013400 mg/kg daily) have been associated with toxicity in neonates. Several deaths have been reported in neonates weighing <2.5 kg in whom bacteriostatic sodium chloride for injection containing 0.9% benzyl alcohol was used for flushing IV catheters; some of these neonates received additional benzyl alcohol when bacteriostatic sodium chloride injection was used to dilute or reconstitute drugs. No substantial differences in safety and efficacy relative to younger adults. Substantially eliminated by the kidneys; monitor renal function since geriatric patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. (See Geriatric Patients under Dosage and Administration and also see Sodium Content under Cautions.) Use with extreme caution, if at all, in patients with liver cirrhosis. Use with extreme caution, if at all, in patients with severe renal insufficiency. Risk of sodium retention in patients with diminished renal function. Monitor renal function. (See Renal Impairment under Dosage and Administration and also see Sodium Content under Cautions.)"}

{"Question": "What is Zeposia used for?", "Answer": "Zeposia ( ozanimod ) capsules are used to treat adults with types relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). Zeposia helps to reduce the relapse rate and the number and size of brain lesions in multiple sclerosis. For ulcerative colitis, Zeposia is used to reduce symptoms, and it can also help achieve and maintain remission. Zeposia is FDA-approved to treat adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and also FDA-approved to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease. Multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis are both autoimmune disorders where the immune cells (lymphocytes) are thought to incorrectly start attacking your healthy tissue, thinking that it is a foreign substance. In multiple sclerosis, the immune system attacks and damages the myelin sheath that covers the nerves in the brain and spinal cord (CNS). This disrupts the brain from sending signals to the rest of the body and causes symptoms including numbness and tingling in the face, arms, feet, and legs, balance issues and trouble walking, vision problems, bowel and bladder problems, fatigue, and problems thinking and concentrating. In ulcerative colitis, the immune system attacks and causes inflammation in the lining of the colon which causes the symptoms of abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, bowel urgency, diarrhea, and tiredness."}

Salbutamol works by stimulating the beta-2 adrenoceptors in your bronchial muscles, which are the smooth muscles lining the two large tubes (bronchi) that carry air from your windpipe (trachea) to your lungs. This causes your bronchi to relax and dilate, widening your airway for a short period of about 4 to 6 hours and making it easier for you to breathe. It can also act on beta-2 adrenoceptors in your uterus (womb). Branded and generic formulations of salbutamol are available worldwide. In many countries this medication is known by the generic name salbutamol, which is the generic name assigned using the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) system. In the US, however, salbutamol is known by the name albuterol (ProAir, Ventolin), which is the generic name assigned using the United States Adopted Names (USAN) system.

{"Question": "What is Imbruvica used for?", "Answer": "Imbruvica (ibrutinib) is used to treat Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia (WM), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) in certain patients. Imbruvica is used to help slow cancer or disease progression in WM, CLL, SLL and cGVHD.\u00a0 Imbruvica is taken once a day as a capsule, tablet or oral suspension. Imbruvica works by blocking an enzyme called Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK) which lowers the survival of cancerous B cells and slows the spread of CLL or SLL. In WM Imbruvica helps abnormal B cells move out of the nourishing environments in the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other organs, and Imbruvica also inhibits specific immune cells that are involved in cGVHD. Imbruvica's mechanism of action is by directly inhibiting an enzyme, called Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK). It forms a covalent bond with a cysteine residue on the enzyme, preventing its activity. BTK works as a signaling molecule for the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. Activation of these pathways causes the proliferation of B cells and other interactions, and inhibition has been shown to reduce the growth and spread of malignant B cells. It belongs to the class of medicines known as BTK inhibitors . Imbruvica was first FDA-approved on November 13, 2013."}

{"Question": "What are the warnings for Cefuroxime?", "Answer": "Known hypersensitivity to cefuroxime or other cephalosporins. Possible emergence and overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms with prolonged therapy. Careful observation of the patient is essential. Institute appropriate therapy if superinfection occurs. Treatment with anti-infectives alters normal colon flora and may permit overgrowth of Clostridium difficile . C. difficile infection (CDI) and C. difficile -associated diarrhea and colitis (CDAD; also known as antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis or pseudomembranous colitis) reported with nearly all anti-infectives, including cefuroxime, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to development of CDAD; hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile are associated with increased morbidity and mortality since they may be refractory to anti-infectives and colectomy may be required. Consider CDAD if diarrhea develops during or after therapy and manage accordingly. Obtain careful medical history since CDAD may occur as late as 2 months or longer after anti-infective therapy is discontinued. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, discontinue anti-infectives not directed against C. difficile whenever possible. Initiate appropriate supportive therapy (e.g., fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation), anti-infective therapy directed against C. difficile (e.g., metronidazole, vancomycin), and surgical evaluation as clinically indicated. Possible hypersensitivity reactions, including rash (maculopapular or erythematous), pruritus, fever, eosinophilia, urticaria, anaphylaxis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue and institute appropriate therapy as indicated (e.g., epinephrine, corticosteroids, maintenance of an adequate airway and oxygen). Partial cross-sensitivity among cephalosporins and other \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, including penicillins and cephamycins. Prior to initiation of therapy, make careful inquiry concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins, penicillins, or other drugs. Cautious use recommended in individuals hypersensitive to penicillins: avoid use in those who have had an immediate-type (anaphylactic) hypersensitivity reaction and administer with caution in those who have had a delayed-type (e.g., rash, fever, eosinophilia) reaction. Used with caution in patients with a history of GI disease, particularly colitis. (See Superinfection/Clostridium difficile-associated Diarrhea and Colitis under Cautions.) Prolonged PT reported with some cephalosporins. Monitor PT in patients at risk, including those with renal or hepatic impairment, poor nutritional state, receiving prolonged therapy, or stabilized on anticoagulant therapy. Administer vitamin K when indicated. Periodically evaluate renal status during therapy, especially in seriously ill patients receiving maximum dosage. Caution if used concomitantly with nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides, potent diuretics). (See Interactions.) To reduce development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of cefuroxime and other antibacterials, use only for treatment or prevention of infections proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When selecting or modifying anti-infective therapy, use results of culture and in vitro susceptibility testing. In the absence of such data, consider local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns when selecting anti-infectives for empiric therapy. Mild to moderate hearing loss reported rarely in pediatric patients who received cefuroxime for treatment of meningitis. Persistence of positive CSF cultures at 18\u201336 hours reported; clinical importance unknown. Ceftin oral suspensions containing 125 or 250 mg of cefuroxime/5 mL contain aspartame (NutraSweet ), which is metabolized in the GI tract to provide 11.8 or 25.2 mg of phenylalanine/5 mL, respectively. Cefuroxime sodium contains approximately 54.2 mg (2.4 mEq) of sodium per g of cefuroxime. Category B. Distributed into milk; use with caution. Safety and efficacy of oral or parenteral cefuroxime not established in children <3 months of age. Other cephalosporins accumulate in neonates resulting in prolonged serum half-life. Safety and efficacy of oral cefuroxime for treatment of acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis in pediatric patients 3 months to 12 years of age have been established based on safety and efficacy of the drug in adults. In addition, use of oral cefuroxime in pediatric patients is supported by pharmacokinetic and safety data in adult and pediatric patients, clinical and microbiologic data from adequate and well-controlled studies of the treatment of acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis in adults and acute otitis media with effusion in pediatric patients, and postmarketing surveillance of adverse effects. Tablets should not be crushed for pediatric administration since the drug has a strong, persistent, bitter taste; vomiting was induced aversively in some children who received crushed tablets. The oral suspension should be used in children who cannot swallow tablets whole. To avoid overdosage, the commercially available Duplex drug delivery system containing 750 mg or 1.5 g of cefuroxime and 50 mL of dextrose injection in separate chambers should not be used in pediatric patients unless the entire 750-mg or 1.5-g dose is required. No overall differences in safety and efficacy in those \u226565 years of age compared with younger adults, but the possibility of increased sensitivity in some geriatric individuals cannot be ruled out. Substantially eliminated by kidneys; risk of toxicity may be greater in those with impaired renal function. Select dosage with caution; renal function monitoring may be useful because of age-related decreases in renal function. (See Renal Impairment under Dosage and Administration.) Possible decreased clearance and increased serum half-life. Dosage adjustments of parenteral cefuroxime necessary in patients with Cl cr \u226420 mL/minute. (See Renal Impairment under Dosage and Administration.) Safety and efficacy of oral cefuroxime in patients with renal impairment not established. GI effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea/loose stools), hypersensitivity reactions, local reactions at IV injection sites."}

{"Question": "What are the warnings for Ibandronate?", "Answer": "Oral: Esophageal abnormalities that delay esophageal emptying (e.g., stricture, achalasia). Oral and IV: Uncorrected hypocalcemia. Oral and IV: Known hypersensitivity to ibandronate or any ingredient in the formulation. Oral: Inability to stand or sit upright for \u226560 minutes. Possible severe adverse esophageal effects (e.g., esophagitis, esophageal ulcers, erosions, strictures, perforation). (See Oral Administration under Dosage and Administration.) Monitor for any manifestations and discontinue if dysphagia, odynophagia, new or worsening heartburn, or retrosternal pain occurs. Use with caution in patients with active upper GI disease (e.g., Barrett\u2019s esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, ulcers). Gastric and duodenal ulcers (some severe and with complications) reported during postmarketing experience. Injection must be administered IV by a health-care professional; do not administer by non-IV (e.g., intra-arterial) routes. (See Administration Risks under Dosage and Administration.) Correct hypocalcemia, hypovitaminosis D, and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism before initiating therapy. If daily intake inadequate, administer supplemental calcium and vitamin D. Osteonecrosis and osteomyelitis of the jaw reported in patients receiving bisphosphonates. Most cases associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing. Known risk factors include cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor oral hygiene, and comorbid disorders (e.g., periodontal and/or other preexisting dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures). Risk also may be increased with increased duration of bisphosphonate use. If osteonecrosis of the jaw develops, consult an oral surgeon for treatment. Dental surgery may exacerbate condition. In patients requiring dental procedures, discontinuance of therapy prior to procedure may reduce the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw. Base management of patients requiring dental treatment on an individual assessment of risks and benefits. Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain reported infrequently with bisphosphonate therapy. Time to onset varied from 1 day to years (mean onset about 3 months) after treatment initiation. If severe symptoms occur, consider discontinuing drug. Such pain generally improves following discontinuance, but may recur upon subsequent rechallenge with the same drug or another bisphosphonate. Atypical (subtrochanteric or diaphyseal) femur fractures reported rarely with long-term use (>3 years) of bisphosphonates, mostly in patients receiving these drugs for osteoporosis. Often occurs with minimal or no trauma, and may be bilateral. Causality not established; atypical fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients not receiving bisphosphonates. Risk may be increased with concomitant use of glucocorticoid, estrogen, and proton-pump inhibitor therapy. Evaluate patients who present with new thigh or groin pain for possibility of an atypical femoral fracture; include assessment of the contralateral limb. Consider interruption of bisphosphonate therapy in patients with manifestations of possible femoral fracture; weigh risks versus benefits of continued treatment. Discontinue if a femoral shaft fracture is confirmed. Although data are conflicting, possible increased risk of atrial fibrillation with use of bisphosphonates. FDA analysis of data from long-term (6 months to 3 years) controlled trials identified a higher rate of atrial fibrillation in patients receiving bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate, or zoledronic acid) versus placebo; however, only a few events reported in each study. FDA is continuing to monitor this safety concern. Some evidence (from postmarketing experience and observational studies) suggests a possible association between use of oral bisphosphonates and an increased risk of esophageal cancer. However, because of conflicting data, additional study needed to confirm such findings. FDA states that benefits of oral bisphosphonates continue to outweigh their potential risks in patients with osteoporosis; it is important to consider that esophageal cancer is rare, especially in women. Avoidance of oral bisphosphonates in patients with Barrett\u2019s esophagus, a known precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma, has been recommended. Possible renal toxicity (e.g., deterioration of renal function and, rarely, renal failure) with bisphosphonates. Risk may be greater in patients with coexisting conditions associated with renal impairment, concomitant therapy with other nephrotoxic drugs, preexisting renal disease, dehydration, dosage, infusion volume and rate, and multiple cycles of treatment. Assess renal function in such patients. Use not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr <30 mL/minute). Measure S cr prior to each IV dose. Withhold treatment if deterioration of renal function occurs. Hypersensitivity reactions, including fatal anaphylaxis in patients who received ibandronate injection, reported. (See Contraindications under Cautions and see IV Administration under Dosage and Administration.) No data in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. In reproductive animal studies, maternal and fetal toxicity (including postimplantation loss, developmental anomalies, and deaths) observed. Distributed into milk in rats; not known whether distributed into human milk. Also not known whether the drug has any effects on the nursing infant or milk production. Safety and efficacy not established in children. Not indicated for use in children. No substantial differences in safety and efficacy relative to younger adults, but increased sensitivity cannot be ruled out. Consider age-related decreases in renal function. Use not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr <30 mL/minute). Oral: Back pain, dyspepsia, pain in the extremities, diarrhea, headache, myalgia. IV: Arthralgia, back pain, abdominal pain."}

{"Question": "What is Melatonin used for?", "Answer": "Melatonin is the natural hormone your body secretes that helps to maintain your wake-sleep cycle (also called \u201cbiological clock\u201d). Melatonin is also made synthetically and available without a prescription as an over-the-counter (OTC) dietary supplement in the U.S. Melatonin is most commonly used to: The wake-sleep cycle is the process of sleep and wakefulness; in humans this averages 8 hours of nighttime sleep and 16 hours of daytime activity. Supplemental Melatonin has been suggested to have many uses, from sleep disorders to cancer treatment, but adequate studies are lacking for many uses. It has been widely studied for treatment of jet lag and other sleep disorders. Endogenous melatonin release (made by our bodies) is increased each day in response to darkness, peaking between 11PM and 3AM at roughly 200 picograms (pg) per mL. Nighttime levels are roughly 10 times higher than in the daytime. Levels fall sharply before daylight, and are barely detectable in the daylight hours. The rise and fall in endogenous levels signal wake and sleep times, known as our circadian rhythm. Natural melatonin production starts from the amino acid tryptophan, with serotonin as an intermediary, and then is released to the receptors in the brain, eye and other areas to help control the sleep quality and wake cycles. The half-life is short, roughly 20 to 50 minutes. It is metabolized (broken down) by the CYP450 enzyme system in the liver and then excreted in the urine or feces. Shorter periods of production occur in the summer with longer days, and more prolonged periods of production occur in the winter. Light at night (such as from smartphones or the TV) blocks production and can lead to sleep disturbances. Age also suppresses the levels of nighttime melatonin that are released, which may contribute to the problem of insomnia and early awakening often seen in older adults."}

{"Question": "What is Voydeya used for?", "Answer": "Voydeya (danicopan) is an oral complement factor D inhibitor that may be used to treat extravascular hemolysis (EVH) in adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) as add-on therapy to ravulizumab ( Ultomiris ) or eculizumab ( Soliris ) when patients have had an insufficient response to these treatments. Voydeya addresses the needs of 10-20% of patients with PNH who experience clinically significant EVH despite treatment with a C5 inhibitor. EVH involves the destruction of red blood cells outside of the blood vessels. Voydeya (danicopan) works by specifically binding to complement Factor D (part of the immune system) which plays a key role in the formation of the alternative pathway, which can result in an over responsive complement system and the body attacking its own cells. It prevents its cleavage into Ba and Bb fragments that are required for the formation of an enzyme involved in EVH. Co-administered ravulizumab or eculizumab helps maintain control over membrane attack complex (MAC)-mediated intravascular hemolysis (IVH) \u2013 which is the destruction of red blood cells inside the blood vessels. Voydeya was FDA approved on 29 March 2024."}

{"Question": "What is Jornay PM used for?", "Answer": "Jornay PM is a once-a-day capsule used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It contains a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant called methylphenidate hydrochloride. It's not known exactly how Jornay PM works in people with ADHD, but it is a stimulant that increases activity in the brain, especially in the areas that help regulate behavior and attention. It helps to boost the levels of dopamine and noradrenaline, which are chemical messengers (neurotransmitters), by preventing their re-uptake from the space between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. Low levels of these chemical messengers have been found in people with ADHD. Jornay PM is taken in the evening. Each capsule contains two layers. The outside layer is designed to delay the release of the drug so that it doesn't start to be released until about 12 hours after it is taken. The inside layer extends the amount of time the drug is released into your body for. The two-layer approach is designed to help ensure Jornay PM is working when you wake up and keeps working during the day. Medications containing methylphenidate, such as Jornay PM, are schedule II federally controlled substances because they can be a target for people who abuse prescription medicines or street drugs. Selling or giving away Jornay PM may harm others, and is against the law. Jornay PM was approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018, although methylphenidate in another formulation was first approved many years earlier in 1955."}

PNH is a rare acquired, life-threatening disease of the blood that is characterized by the destruction of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia), blood clots (thrombosis), and impaired bone marrow function. Empaveli works by binding to specific proteins in the complement system, which is a part of the immune system that enhances (or complements) the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear microbes and damaged cells from an organism, promote inflammation, and attack the pathogen's cell membrane. Empaveli binds to complement protein C3 and prevents it from splitting into C3a and C3b. This helps to stop intravascular hemolysis (IVH or the destruction of red blood cells in the circulation) and extravascular hemolysis (EVH or the breakdown of red blood cells in the spleen, bone marrow, or liver by macrophages). Empaveli is the only treatment that targets C3 and may prevent both forms of red blood cell destruction (IVH and EVH). It works higher in the complement system than other treatments used for PNH. Empaveli was FDA approved on May 14, 2021 and is only approved as PNH treatment. There is no Empaveli generic."}

{"Question": "What is Canasa used for?", "Answer": "Canasa (mesalamine) is a suppository used to treat a type of inflammatory bowel disease called ulcerative proctitis. Ulcerative proctitis causes inflammation, redness and ulcers to develop in the lining of the rectum, which is at the end of your large intestine. Ulcerative proctitis may also affect nearby parts of the colon. Canasa contains the medication mesalamine, which is also known as mesalazine or 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). It is contained inside a base of hard fat. Canasa is used topically and is inserted into the rectum. As the warmth of your body melts the hard fat base, the drug is released into the area where it needs to work. Canasa belongs to a class of drugs called aminosalicylates . Canasa is thought to work by reducing inflammation in the epithelial cells that line the colon. Its anti-inflammatory action may result from its ability to block the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX) and inhibit prostaglandin production in the colon. COX and prostaglandins (a group of lipids) are both involved in generating an inflammatory response. Medications containing mesalamine have been available for many years, however, Canasa was first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2001. When Canasa was first approved it was available as a 500 mg strength suppository that needed to be used twice a day.

Actrema was FDA approved to treat COVID-19 on December 21, 2022, for specific adult patients. Pediatric patients (aged 2 years to 18 years) with COVID-19 still have access to Actrema under emergency use authorization (EUA). Actrema is a monoclonal antibody that blocks a protein in your body called interleukin-6 (IL-6).\u00a0 If this protein is activated, it causes your immune system to be overactive which results in inflammation and the signs and symptoms of autoimmune disease.\u00a0As Actrema blocks the interleukin-6 receptor, this is how it is thought to reduce the immune system from being overactive, so there is less inflammation and a reduction in the signs and symptoms of autoimmune diseases. At a more technical level the mode of action (MOA) of Actrema is that it binds to IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R) which have been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling through these receptors. Interleukin-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is made by a variety of cell types including T- and B-cells, lymphocytes, monocytes and fibroblasts.

{"Question": "What is Fexofenadine used for?", "Answer": "Fexofenadine is an antihistamine that may be used to treat allergy symptoms (including hay fever) in adults and children. Fexofenadine is also used to treat skin itching and hives caused by a condition called chronic idiopathic urticaria in adults and children who are at least 6 years old. Fexofenadine works selectively on histamine-1 receptors that are located in our body, but not in our central nervous system - these are called peripheral histamine receptors. Because it acts on these receptors, fexofenadine is much less likely to cause drowsiness compared with some older antihistamines. Histamine is a chemical that is released by mast cells in response to an allergen, and it is responsible for many allergy symptoms, such as watery eyes, a runny nose, sneezing, and itching. Fexofenadine binds to histamine receptors and prevents histamine from having an effect on those receptors, which reduces allergy symptoms. There are many brands and forms of fexofenadine available. Fexofenadine was FDA approved in 1996."}

Patients with such mutations are at increased risk for acute early-onset and severe, life-threatening, or fatal toxicity (e.g., mucositis, diarrhea, neutropenia, neurotoxicity). Patients with partial DPD activity also may have increased risk of severe, life-threatening, or fatal toxicity. Safety not established in patients with complete absence of DPD activity. Data insufficient to support dosage recommendations for those with partial DPD activity. Myocardial ischemia/infarction, heart failure, arrhythmias, and angina (including Prinzmetal variant angina) reported. Administration of drug by continuous IV infusion and presence of coronary artery disease may increase risk of cardiotoxicity. Safety of resuming fluorouracil after resolution of cardiotoxicity not established. Disorientation, confusion, ataxia, visual disturbances, and acute cerebellar syndrome reported. Insufficient data on risks of resuming fluorouracil after resolution of neurologic adverse effects. Hyperammonemic encephalopathy, in the absence of liver disease or other identifiable cause, reported. Altered mental status, confusion, disorientation, ataxia, or coma in presence of elevated serum ammonia concentrations, may occur \u226472 hours following initiation of fluorouracil infusion. If hyperammonemic encephalopathy or neurologic effects occur, temporarily interrupt therapy. Mucositis, stomatitis, and esophagopharyngitis and subsequent mucosal sloughing or ulceration reported more frequently following administration of the drug by direct IV injection compared with administration by continuous IV infusion. Diarrhea occurs frequently and may be severe. Temporarily withhold fluorouracil if grade 3 or 4 diarrhea or mucositis occurs; resume drug at a reduced dosage when the toxicity resolves or improves to grade 1. Potential for diarrhea to result in rapid clinical deterioration and death in patients receiving reduced folates (leucovorin, levoleucovorin) concomitantly; close monitoring is required. Initiate fluid and electrolyte replacement or antidiarrheal therapy as clinically necessary. Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (hand-foot syndrome) reported. Erythematous, desquamative rash that involves the hands and feet, may be accompanied by tingling sensation, pain, swelling, and erythema with tenderness. If grade 2 or 3 hand-foot syndrome occurs, temporarily interrupt therapy until the toxicity resolves or improves to grade 1. May be treated with oral pyridoxine therapy or topical emollients (e.g., hand creams, udder balm). Myelosuppression (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), sometimes severe or fatal, reported. Nadir neutrophil count usually occurs 9\u201314 days following initiation of therapy. Obtain complete blood cell counts (CBCs) prior to each treatment cycle, weekly (if administered on a weekly or similar schedule), and as clinically indicated. If grade 4 myelosuppression occurs, temporarily interrupt therapy until the toxicity resolves or improves to grade 1. May cause fetal harm. Advise women of childbearing potential and men with such female partners to use effective contraceptive methods during fluorouracil therapy and for up to 3 months after the last dose of the drug. If used during pregnancy or if patient becomes pregnant, apprise of potential fetal hazard. Results of animal studies suggest that fluorouracil may impair male and female fertility. Category D.

Atorvastatin calcium works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body. Atorvastatin is used together with diet, weight loss, and exercise to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke and to decrease the chance that heart surgery will be needed in people who have heart disease or who are at risk of developing heart disease. Atorvastatin is also used to lower the amount of fatty substances such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol') and triglycerides in the blood and to increase the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ('good cholesterol') in the blood. Atorvastatin may also be used to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood in children and teenagers 10 to 17 years of age who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats with atorvastatin has been shown to prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks."}

Verzenio is also used along with fulvestrant (Faslodex) to treat a certain type of hormone receptor-positive, advanced breast cancer (breast cancer that depends on hormones such as estrogen to grow) or breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body after treatment with an antiestrogen medication such as tamoxifen. Verzenio is also used along with anastrozole (Arimidex), exemestane (Aromasin), or letrozole (Femara) as a first treatment of hormone receptor-positive, advanced breast cancer or breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Verzenio is also used alone to treat a certain type of hormone receptor-positive, advanced breast cancer or breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body in people who have already been treated with an antiestrogen medication and chemotherapy. Abemaciclib works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of cancer cells.

{"Question": "What is Xermelo used for?", "Answer": "Xermelo tablets are used to treat carcinoid syndrome diarrhea in adults, Xermelo works by blocking the enzyme that helps make serotonin which reduces the amount of serotonin being made to help prevent diarrhea. Xermelo (telotristat ethyl) is a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor that specifically targets the underlying cause of carcinoid syndrome diarrhea, which is high serotonin levels. Xermelo is not a chemotherapy. Carcinoid syndrome diarrhea is caused by carcinoid tumors releasing too much serotonin, which increases wave-like contractions in the gut (peristalsis). These contractions reduce how much water and electrolyte is absorbed from the gut, which leads to diarrhea. Carcinoid syndrome is a rare condition that affects people with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (mNETs). Xermelo is used together with medications such as octreotide ( Sandostatin ), which is a somatostatin analog (SSA) therapy; Xermelo is used with SSA therapy when the SSA therapy has not effectively controlled the diarrhea on its own. Medications like octreotide work by blocking the release of serotonin. When Xermelo is combined with SSA therapy, they work well together as Xermelo reduces how much serotonin is made, and SSA therapy decreases the amount of serotonin released, leading to an improvement in carcinoid syndrome diarrhea symptoms. Xermelo received FDA approval on February 28, 2017. Xermelo is indicated for treating carcinoid syndrome diarrhea in combination with somatostatin analog (SSA) therapy, such as octreotide in adults whose carcinoid syndrome diarrhea has not been controlled by SSA therapy."}

{"Question": "What is Heparin Sodium used for?", "Answer": "Treatment of DVT and PE. Recommended by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) as an appropriate choice of anticoagulant for initial treatment of acute proximal DVT or PE. LMWHs or fondaparinux generally preferred over heparin for initial treatment of acute venous thromboembolism; however, heparin may be preferred in patients with renal impairment. IV heparin also may be preferred over sub-Q therapies in patients with PE in whom thrombolytic therapy is being considered or if there is concern about adequate sub-Q absorption. After full-dose heparin therapy, warfarin or an LMWH generally is administered as follow-up anticoagulant therapy for \u22653 months in adults with venous thromboembolism. Prophylaxis of postoperative DVT and PE in patients undergoing general (e.g., abdominal) surgery who are at risk of thromboembolism. ACCP recommends pharmacologic (e.g., low-dose heparin) and/or nonpharmacologic/mechanical (e.g., intermittent pneumatic compression) methods of thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing general surgery, including abdominal, GI, gynecologic, and urologic surgery, according to the patient\u2019s risk of thromboembolism and bleeding. In general, pharmacologic prophylaxis is recommended in patients with high (and possibly moderate) risk of venous thromboembolism who do not have a high risk of bleeding, while mechanical methods are suggested in patients who require thromboprophylaxis but have a high risk of bleeding. If pharmacologic prophylaxis is indicated in patients undergoing general surgery, ACCP states that an LMWH or low-dose heparin is preferred. ACCP states that the same recommendations for use of antithrombotic agents in general surgery patients can be applied to patients undergoing bariatric, vascular, and plastic/reconstructive surgery. Mechanical methods of prophylaxis generally recommended in patients undergoing cardiac surgery; however, ACCP states that low-dose heparin may be considered in cardiac surgery patients with a complicated postoperative course. Has been used for prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing craniotomy \u2020 [off-label] ; however, benefits may be outweighed by possible increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. ACCP states that the addition of low-dose heparin to a mechanical method of prophylaxis may be considered in patients at very high risk of thromboembolism (e.g., those undergoing craniotomy for malignant disease) once adequate hemostasis established and risk of bleeding decreases. Also may be considered as a possible addition to mechanical prophylaxis in high-risk patients undergoing spinal surgery \u2020 [off-label] (e.g., those with malignancy or those undergoing surgery with a combined anterior-posterior approach) once adequate hemostasis established and risk of bleeding decreases. Prevention of postoperative DVT and PE in patients undergoing major thoracic surgery. Pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis (e.g., low-dose heparin) recommended by ACCP in patients undergoing thoracic surgery who are at high risk of venous thromboembolism, provided risk of bleeding is low. Has been used for prevention of DVT and PE in patients undergoing total hip-replacement surgery \u2020 [off-label] , total knee-replacement surgery \u2020 [off-label] , or hip-fracture surgery \u2020 [off-label] . ACCP recommends routine thromboprophylaxis (with a pharmacologic and/or mechanical method) in all patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery because of high risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism; continue thromboprophylaxis for at least 10\u201314 days, and possibly for up to 35 days after surgery. Among several antithrombotic agents (e.g., LMWH, fondaparinux, low-dose heparin, warfarin, aspirin) recommended for pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery, ACCP states LMWHs generally preferred; may consider alternative agents when an LMWH is not available or cannot be used. When selecting an appropriate thromboprophylaxis regimen, consider factors such as relative efficacy and safety of the drugs in addition to other logistics and compliance issues. Used for prevention of DVT and PE in acutely ill hospitalized medical patients and in those with medical conditions associated with a high risk of thromboembolism (e.g., cancer). In general, pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis recommended only in patients considered to be at high risk of venous thromboembolism. ACCP recommends anticoagulant prophylaxis (e.g., low-dose heparin) in acutely ill, hospitalized medical patients at increased risk of thrombosis who are not actively bleeding and do not have an increased risk of bleeding. Continued thromboprophylaxis suggested for 6\u201321 days until full mobility is restored or hospital discharge. Low-dose heparin also suggested by ACCP for pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in critically ill patients (e.g., those in an intensive care unit [ICU]) who are not actively bleeding and do not have risk factors for bleeding. Risk of venous thromboembolism is particularly high in patients with cancer. Use of low-dose heparin suggested by ACCP in cancer (solid tumors) outpatients who have additional risk factors for thromboembolism, provided risk of bleeding is low. Low-dose heparin may be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients with major trauma \u2020 . For major trauma patients at high risk of venous thromboembolism, including those with acute spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, or spinal surgery for trauma, ACCP suggests the use of both a pharmacologic and mechanical method of prophylaxis, unless contraindications exist. Has been used for prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism during pregnancy; however, an LMWH generally is recommended by ACCP because of a more favorable safety profile. Has been used in combination with low-dose aspirin for prevention of recurrent pregnancy loss in women with antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) syndrome \u2020 . Also has been used with aspirin (often combined with immune globulin) for prevention of venous thromboembolism and early pregnancy loss in women who have undergone in vitro fertilization \u2020 . Has been used for treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism in neonates and children \u2020 ; venous thromboembolism usually occurs secondary to an identifiable risk factor (e.g., presence of central venous access device) in such patients. Recommendations regarding use of antithrombotic therapy in children generally based on extrapolation from adult guidelines. In children with central venous catheters (or umbilical venous catheters) who experience venous thromboembolism, ACCP recommends removal of catheter if no longer functioning or required; at least 3\u20135 days of therapeutic anticoagulation suggested prior to removal. If such catheters must remain in place, ACCP suggests anticoagulant therapy until catheter is removed. Has been used to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients undergoing electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion \u2020 for atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin may be used in patients in whom prolonged anticoagulation (e.g., with warfarin for \u22653 weeks) prior to cardioversion is not necessary or not possible; in these situations, heparin or an LMWH generally is administered at the time of transesophageal echocardiograph (TEE) or at presentation (for those with atrial fibrillation \u226448 hours) just prior to cardioversion. In patients with hemodynamic instability who require urgent cardioversion, ACCP suggests administration of IV heparin or an LMWH prior to cardioversion, if possible; however, such anticoagulant therapy must not delay any emergency intervention. Used during conversion to maintenance warfarin therapy to reduce the incidence of thromboembolism (e.g., stroke) in patients with prosthetic mechanical heart valves \u2020 . ACCP suggests bridging anticoagulation (administration of an LMWH in either prophylactic or therapeutic dosages or IV heparin in prophylactic dosages) during the early postoperative period after insertion of a mechanical heart valve until patient is stable on warfarin therapy. Also may be used for bridging anticoagulation in patients with a mechanical heart valve in whom therapy with warfarin must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., for major surgery). ACC and AHA state that perioperative use of heparin should be considered for noncardiac surgery, invasive procedures, or dental procedures in patients with prosthetic heart valves who are at high risk for thrombosis without oral antithrombotic therapy (e.g., those with any mechanical mitral valve or a mechanical aortic valve with additional risk factors). Used for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with prosthetic mechanical heart valves \u2020 . (See Thromboembolism During Pregnancy under Dosage and Administration.) Renal vein thrombosis \u2020 is the most common cause of spontaneous venous thromboembolism in neonates. Although use of anticoagulant therapy in patients with renal vein thrombosis is controversial, heparin is suggested by ACCP as a possible treatment option in selected neonates. Used to reduce the extent of ischemic injury in patients with acute arterial emboli or thrombosis; however, ACCP states formal studies demonstrating improved outcomes have not been conducted. In patients with limb ischemia secondary to arterial emboli or thrombosis, immediate systemic anticoagulation with heparin to prevent thrombotic propagation is suggested by ACCP. Prophylaxis during cardiac catheterization via an artery in neonates and children. If femoral artery thrombosis occurs following cardiac catheterization, therapeutic-dose IV heparin is recommended, followed by subsequent conversion to an LMWH or continued treatment with heparin to complete 5\u20137 days of therapeutic anticoagulation. Prevention of activation of the coagulation mechanism during arterial and cardiac surgery. A nonheparin anticoagulant (e.g., bivalirudin) may be used in place of heparin in patients with acute heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or subacute HIT (platelets have recovered, but HIT antibodies still present) who require urgent cardiac surgery. Because HIT antibodies are transient, ACCP states that short-term use of heparin may be appropriate in patients with a remote (>3 months) history of HIT and no detectable antibodies who require cardiac surgery. Treatment of acute and chronic consumptive coagulopathies, including disseminated intravascular coagulation. Maintenance of patency of indwelling peripheral or central venipuncture devices designed for intermittent injections and/or blood sampling. ACCP suggests use of heparin flushes as an option for primary thromboprophylaxis of central venous access devices in children. In neonates and children with peripheral arterial catheters, ACCP recommends continuous IV infusion of heparin (in low concentrations) via the catheter for prophylaxis. Also may consider use of heparin for treatment if symptomatic catheter-related thromboembolism occurs. In neonates with umbilical arterial catheters, ACCP also suggests thromboprophylaxis with low-dose heparin via the catheter to maintain patency. Used in combination with antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin) during and after successful coronary artery reperfusion (e.g., thrombolytic agents) for prevention of ischemic complications of STEMI \u2020 (e.g., death, reinfarction, stroke). The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and AHA state that patients with STEMI undergoing thrombolytic therapy should receive an anticoagulant (e.g., heparin, enoxaparin, fondaparinux) for \u226548 hours, and preferably for the duration of the index hospitalization, up to 8 days or until revascularization is performed. Enoxaparin is preferred over heparin if extended anticoagulation (>48 hours) is necessary. Used to reduce the risk of thrombotic complications in patients undergoing PCI. Used in conjunction with aspirin and other standard therapy (e.g., GP IIb/IIIa-receptor inhibitors, P2Y12 receptor antagonists). Use of a parenteral anticoagulant is recommended in patients undergoing PCI to prevent thrombus formation during the procedure. IV heparin is recommended by AHA, the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) as an appropriate choice of anticoagulant. Reduction in the risk of acute cardiac ischemic events (death and/or MI) in patients with NSTE ACS (unstable angina or non-ST-segment-elevation MI [NSTEMI]) \u2020 . Used concurrently with aspirin and/or other standard therapy (e.g., nitrates, \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agents [\u03b2-blockers], P2Y12 receptor antagonists). Initial parenteral anticoagulants with established efficacy in patients with NSTE ACS include enoxaparin, heparin, bivalirudin (only in patients managed with an early invasive strategy), and fondaparinux. In patients who will undergo CABG, if heparin is already being administered, continue during surgery. If patient is receiving other anticoagulants (enoxaparin, fondaparinux, or bivalirudin), discontinue other anticoagulant and use heparin during CABG. In patients in whom conservative medical therapy is selected as a postangiographic management strategy, recommendations for continued antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy generally are based on the presence of CAD. May be used for treatment of acute cerebral venous sinus (sinovenous) thrombosis \u2020 in adults. May convert to oral anticoagulant therapy once patient is stabilized. Recommended by ACCP as an option for initial anticoagulation in children with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis \u2020 without substantial intracranial hemorrhage. Also has been suggested for use in such children with substantial hemorrhage. Heparin anticoagulants (i.e., LMWH or heparin) have been used for thromboprophylaxis in selected patients with acute ischemic stroke \u2020 ; those with additional risk factors for venous thromboembolism are more likely to benefit. ACCP suggests thromboprophylaxis with an LMWH (in prophylactic dosages), sub-Q heparin, or intermittent pneumatic compression in patients with acute ischemic stroke \u2020 and restricted mobility; LMWH is preferred over heparin. Prophylactic-dose heparin usually initiated within 48 hours of onset of stroke and continued throughout hospital stay until patient regains mobility; do not administer within the first 24 hours after thrombolytic therapy. Also has been used for initial management of acute arterial ischemic stroke in children \u2020 until dissection and embolic causes have been excluded. In children with acute arterial ischemic stroke secondary to non-Moyamoya vasculopathy \u2020 , ACCP recommends ongoing antithrombotic therapy (e.g., heparin) for 3 months. Heparin may be considered in neonates with a first episode of arterial ischemic stroke associated with a documented cardioembolic source. Used in the perioperative management of patients who require temporary interruption of long-term warfarin therapy for surgery or other invasive procedures. ACCP suggests perioperative use of an LMWH or IV heparin (bridging anticoagulation) in selected patients with venous thromboembolism, atrial fibrillation, or mechanical prosthetic heart valves depending on their risk of developing thromboembolism without warfarin therapy. In general, bridging anticoagulation is suggested in such patients who are considered to be at particularly high risk of venous thromboembolism without oral anticoagulant therapy. Used as an in vitro anticoagulant in blood transfusions. Used for anticoagulation during extracorporeal circulation and dialysis procedures."}

Drug of choice (combined with leucovorin or levoleucovorin and other drugs [e.g., irinotecan, oxaliplatin]) for advanced colorectal cancer in the adjuvant or metastatic setting. Doublet regimens (i.e., fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and leucovorin or levoleucovorin [FOLFOX]; fluorouracil, irinotecan, and leucovorin or levoleucovorin [FOLFIRI]; capecitabine and oxaliplatin [CapeOx; CapOx]) are the current standard of care for the adjuvant or palliative treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. Fluorouracil combined with leucovorin or levoleucovorin is an acceptable treatment option in limited-resource settings or in patients unable to tolerate a doublet regimen. Weekly schedule of fluorouracil/leucovorin (high-dose leucovorin or Roswell Park regimen) has equal efficacy as monthly schedule (low-dose or Mayo Clinic schedule), but the weekly schedule is a preferred regimen for adjuvant therapy because of ease of use and less toxicity. (See Colorectal Cancer under Dosage and Administration.) Bimonthly, continuous IV infusion schedule of fluorouracil/leucovorin (LV5FU2 or deGramont regimen) also evaluated as adjuvant therapy and shown to be safer than direct IV injection regimen of these drugs.

Betamethasone topical is available in a cream, gel, ointment, lotion, foam, or spray.

The absorption and potency of a topical steroid can also vary depending on the vehicle used to deliver the steroid (such as a cream, gel, lotion, or ointment) and if it has been augmented or not. Augmentation refers to enhancing the vehicle with a substance, such as propylene glycol, to allow it to penetrate the skin more quickly and work faster.

{"Question": "What is Diastat used for?", "Answer": "Diastat AcuDial is a rectal gel used to treat seizures in people with epilepsy . Diastat AcuDial contains the medication diazepam, which belongs to a class of drugs called benzodiazepine anticonvulsant medications. Diastat AcuDial works by reducing the excitability of nerve cells or neurons in the brain. It does this by helping a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) work. GABA is a chemical messenger that blocks impulses between nerve cells. Diastat AcuDial is given via a rectal delivery system. The rectal delivery system combines a pre-filled syringe with a plastic applicator with a flexible, molded tip which is used to deliver the medication into the rectum. The syringe has a window on it that displays the dose and a green band that confirms when the dose is ready to be given. Diastat AcuDial contains the same gel formulation of diazepam as Diastat, which uses an older rectal delivery system that doesn't have a window displaying the dose of the medication. Diastat was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997. When the new delivery system - Diastat AcuDial - was approved in 2005, only the lowest strength pre-filled syringe of Diastat (containing diazepam 2.5mg/0.5ml) remained on the market. The higher strength versions of Diastat were discontinued at that time."}

{"Question": "What is Spinraza used for?", "Answer": "Spinraza is a type of medication called an antisense oligonucleotide. It is used to treat children and adults with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a type of motor neuron disease. It was the first drug to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this group of people. SMA is an inherited disorder that causes skeletal muscle weakness and wasting, which worsens with age. SMA is most commonly caused by mutations in a gene called SMN1 (survival motor neuron 1), which leaves the body without enough functional SMN protein to keep motor neurons healthy and functioning. A back-up gene called SMN2 also produces SMN protein, but only a small percentage of the protein produced by SMN2 functions properly. This is because when the protein is being made a portion of the gene called exon 7 tends to be skipped over, so the resulting protein isn't supplied with all of the right building blocks of information it needs to function properly. Spinraza works by fixing the protein produced by SMN2 so that it functions properly. It does this by making sure that the missing piece of information from exon 7 is included. Spinraza was approved by the FDA in 2016."}

{"Question": "What is Tecfidera used for?", "Answer": "Tecfidera ( dimethyl fumarate ) is used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) to help you have fewer relapses, delay the progression of disability, and slow brain lesion development. Tecfidera may help delay the progression of relapsing forms of MS, but it will not cure it. Tecfidera is a delayed-release capsule that is taken twice daily, it is available as 120 mg or 240 mg of dimethyl fumarate . Multiple sclerosis is a long-term condition that affects the brain and the spinal cord (central nervous system). It is caused by your immune system mistakenly attacking the protective covers (myelin sheaths) that surround the nerves of the spinal cord and brain. The inflammation and damage disrupt communication between the brain and other parts of the body, causing MS symptoms, including walking difficulties, feeling off balance, and blurred or double vision. In relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, there are flare-ups (relapses or attacks) of symptoms followed by periods of remission when symptoms stabilize or are no longer noticeable. Tecfidera reduces inflammation and damage to nerves that are caused by the immune system attacking the myelin sheath. It is not known exactly how it works, but it is thought Tecfidera's mechanism of action is the active ingredient dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and its metabolite, monomethyl fumarate (MMF) activates a pathway that is involved in oxidative stress, called the Nrf2 (Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Tecfidera is FDA-approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults. It received FDA approval on March 27, 2013, for Biogen Inc., Cambridge, MA 02142. A Tecfidera generic is now available under the active ingredient name dimethyl fumarate ."}

Used to relieve anaphylactic symptoms (e.g., urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, hypotension, respiratory distress) caused by reactions to drugs, contrast media, insect stings, foods (e.g., milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, peanuts, tree nuts), latex, or other allergens; also used for idiopathic or exercise-induced anaphylaxis. Administer immediately by IM injection as soon as anaphylaxis is diagnosed or strongly suspected. Administration by IM injection preferred, mainly because of safety considerations. However, IV administration may be necessary in extreme situations (e.g., anaphylactic shock, cardiac arrest, unresponsive or severely hypotensive patients who have failed to respond to multiple IM injections). Close hemodynamic monitoring is recommended during IV administration. Also used for its vasopressor effects in the treatment of anaphylactic shock and cardiac arrest associated with anaphylaxis. Manage cardiac arrest secondary to anaphylaxis with standard ACLS measures; consider alternative vasoactive drugs (e.g., vasopressin, norepinephrine) in patients who do not respond to epinephrine. (See ACLS and Cardiac Arrhythmias under Uses.) Consider other interventions (e.g., antihistamines, inhaled \u03b2 2 -adrenergic agents, IV corticosteroids) as clinically indicated. Risk of paradoxical response to epinephrine in patients receiving \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agents; consider glucagon and/or ipratropium for treatment of anaphylaxis in these patients. Used for its \u03b1-adrenergic effects to increase blood flow and facilitate return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) during cardiac arrest. Principal benefits of the drug result from increases in aortic diastolic blood pressure and in coronary and cerebral blood flow during resuscitation. High-quality CPR and defibrillation are the only proven interventions to increase survival to hospital discharge in ACLS. Other resuscitative efforts, including drug therapy, are considered secondary and should be performed without compromising the quality and timely delivery of chest compressions and defibrillation. Principal goal of pharmacologic therapy during cardiac arrest is to facilitate ROSC, and epinephrine is the drug of choice for this use. ACLS guidelines state that administration of epinephrine may be reasonable in adults with VF or pulseless VT resistant to initial CPR attempts and at least one defibrillation shock; optimal timing of administration (particularly in relation to defibrillation) not known and may vary based on patient-specific factors and resuscitation conditions. In adults with asystole or pulseless electrical activity (PEA), epinephrine may be administered as soon as feasible after onset of cardiac arrest. Also may be used in the postresuscitation period to optimize BP, cardiac output, and systemic perfusion after ROSC. Used during the periarrest period for treatment of symptomatic bradycardia in adults; although not a first-line drug, may be considered in patients who are unresponsive to atropine or as a temporizing measure while awaiting availability of a pacemaker. Also used in the emergency treatment of infants and children with bradycardia and cardiopulmonary compromise (with a palpable pulse) when bradycardia persists despite ventilation, oxygenation, and chest compressions. Drugs are rarely needed during resuscitation of neonates; because hypoxemia and inadequate lung inflation are common causes of bradycardia, establishing adequate ventilation is the most important corrective measure in these patients. Also has been used in the treatment of syncope resulting from AV nodal block. However, permanent pacemaker implantation is the treatment of choice for third-degree and advanced second-degree AV nodal block (complete heart block). Used for treatment of hypotension associated with septic shock, generally as a second-line agent. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign International Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock recommend norepinephrine as the first-line vasopressor of choice in adults with septic shock; if adequate BP not achieved, epinephrine may be added. Vasopressor therapy is not a substitute for replacement of blood, plasma, fluids, and/or electrolytes. Correct blood volume depletion as fully as possible before administration of epinephrine. Should not be used in cardiogenic shock (because it increases myocardial oxygen demand) or in hemorrhagic or traumatic shock. May be added to solutions of some local anesthetics to decrease the rate of vascular absorption (to localize and prolong the duration of anesthesia and decrease the risk of systemic toxicity). Has been applied topically to control superficial bleeding from arterioles or capillaries in the skin, mucous membranes, or other tissues. Bleeding from larger vessels is not controllable by topical application. Has been used to relax uterine musculature and inhibit uterine contractions in premature labor \u2020 [off-label] (tocolysis); however, the cardiovascular and other adverse effects limit its usefulness. (See Pregnancy under Cautions.) Other \u03b2-agonists (e.g., terbutaline) preferred. Has been used as an oral bronchodilator for symptomatic treatment of asthma. However, an epinephrine preparation for oral inhalation no longer commercially available in US. While orally inhaled epinephrine was once widely used in the treatment of asthma, the drug has been replaced by more selective and rapid-acting agents (e.g., inhaled \u03b2 2 -adrenergic agonists). Also has been used IV for treatment of severe asthma exacerbations; however, no evidence that the drug improves outcomes compared with selective inhaled \u03b2 2 -adrenergic agonists. Has been used as an endoscopic treatment modality (as a dilute solution injected into and around ulcer base) to produce tamponade and achieve hemostasis in patients with acute nonvariceal upper GI bleeding \u2020 [off-label] . Should not be used as monotherapy; use in combination with additional treatment modality (e.g., clips, thermocoagulation)."}

It is not clear exactly how paracetamol works. However, it is thought to work by blocking chemical messengers in the brain that let us know when we're in pain and by affecting the chemical messengers that regulate our body temperature. The evidence suggests that paracetamol inhibits the production of prostaglandins, which are made by the body to deal with illness and injury. It's also thought to act on the serotonergic, opioid, nitric oxide and cannabinoid pathways. Paracetamol was first made in 1878, but only became more widely used in the 1950s. Today paracetamol is one of the most widely used painkillers in the world. Branded and generic versions of this drug are available."}

{"Question": "What is Nitroglycerin used for?", "Answer": "Management of angina pectoris secondary to CAD. Short-acting preparations (e.g., sublingual nitroglycerin tablets, nitroglycerin spray) used for acute relief of angina; also may be used for acute prophylactic management in situations likely to provoke angina attacks. Sublingual nitroglycerin is considered the drug of choice for acute relief of angina pectoris because it has a rapid onset of action, is inexpensive, and its efficacy is well established. Long-acting preparations (e.g., oral or topical nitroglycerin) used for long-term prophylactic management of chronic stable angina. While \u03b2-blockers are recommended as the anti-ischemic drugs of choice in most patients with chronic stable angina, long-acting nitroglycerin preparations may be substituted or added in patients who do not tolerate or respond adequately to \u03b2-blockers. Acute symptomatic relief of chest pain in patients with NSTE ACS, including unstable angina and non-ST-segment-elevation MI (NSTEMI). Sublingual nitroglycerin (0.3\u20130.4 mg every 5 minutes for up to 3 doses) is recommended in patients with NSTE ACS who have continuing ischemic pain; IV nitroglycerin may be used in patients with heart failure, hypertension, or persistent ischemia not relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin and administration of a \u03b2-blocker. Topical or oral nitrates may be an acceptable alternative to IV therapy in patients who do not have refractory or recurrent ischemia. Management of patients with acute MI. Expert guidelines for the management of ST-segment-elevation MI (STEMI) state that IV nitroglycerin may be beneficial in patients with STEMI and heart failure or hypertension. Experts state there is no role for the routine use of oral nitrates during the convalescent phase of STEMI. Systemic hypotension with resultant worsening of myocardial ischemia is a potential complication of nitroglycerin therapy. Therefore, avoid use in patients with or at risk of hypotension. Avoid use in patients with marked bradycardia (e.g., <50 bpm) or tachycardia (e.g., >100 bpm) and those with suspected right ventricular infarction. IV nitroglycerin is used to control BP in perioperative hypertension, especially hypertension associated with cardiovascular procedures; to control BP in patients with severe hypertension \u2020 [off-label] or in hypertensive crises \u2020 [off-label] for the immediate reduction of BP in patients in whom such reduction is considered an emergency (hypertensive emergencies), especially those associated with coronary complications (e.g., coronary ischemia, acute coronary insufficiency, acute left ventricular failure, postoperative hypertension [especially following coronary bypass surgery]) and/or acute pulmonary edema; and to produce controlled hypotension during surgical procedures. IV nitroglycerin has been used in the management of acutely decompensated (e.g., congestive) heart failure and other low cardiac-output states \u2020 [off-label] . Current guidelines recommend a combination of drug therapies (e.g., ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors [ARNIs], \u03b2-blockers, aldosterone receptor antagonists) in adults with heart failure to reduce morbidity and mortality. IV vasodilators not shown to improve outcomes in patients hospitalized for heart failure; however, IV nitroglycerin may be considered as adjunct to diuretic therapy for relief of dyspnea in patients hospitalized for acutely decompensated heart failure who do not have symptomatic hypotension. Particularly useful in patients with heart failure and hypertension, coronary ischemia, or substantial mitral regurgitation. Tachyphylaxis may develop within 24 hours; some patients may develop resistance to even high doses.

{"Question": "What is Takhzyro used for?", "Answer": "Takhzyro is used to prevent hereditary angioedema (HAE), Takhzyro helps to reduce the number and severity of hereditary angioedema attacks. Takhzyro works by lowering the activity of a protein called kallikrein which helps to prevent the swelling and related symptoms of HAE. Takhzyro is usually given every two weeks as an injection under the skin using a ready-to-use, prefilled syringe. The dose depends on age and can change to every 4 weeks if symptoms have improved. Hereditary angioedema is a rare condition that causes rapid attacks of swelling in areas under the skin around the face, arms, legs, and also the throat, which can be life-threatening if it blocks off the airways. People with hereditary angioedema have high levels of a protein called bradykinin, which makes fluid leak fluid into the surrounding tissue, causing swelling attacks. Takhzyro ( lanadelumab-flyo ) works by blocking another protein in the blood called 'kallikrein', which in turn reduces the level of bradykinin, which helps to prevent the swelling and symptoms of angioedema. Takhzyro approval by the FDA was originally on February 3, 2023, and it is now approved to prevent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adult and pediatric patients 2 years and older. FDA approval was supported by data from HELP Study, the\u00a0 HELP OLE Study and the Phase 3 SPRING Study (NCT SHP643-301). Takhzyro is a plasma kallikrein inhibitor (monoclonal antibody)."}

Lanadelumab works by lowering the activity of a protein called kallikrein which helps to prevent the swelling and related symptoms of HAE. Lanadelumab is usually given every two weeks as an injection under the skin using a ready-to-use, prefilled syringe. The dose depends on age and can change to every 4 weeks if symptoms have improved. Hereditary angioedema is a rare condition that causes rapid attacks of swelling in areas under the skin around the face, arms, legs, and also the throat, which can be life-threatening if it blocks off the airways. People with hereditary angioedema have high levels of a protein called bradykinin, which makes fluid leak fluid into the surrounding tissue, causing swelling attacks.\u00a0 Lanadelumab-flyo works by blocking another protein in the blood called 'kallikrein', which in turn reduces the level of bradykinin, which helps to prevent the swelling and symptoms of angioedema. Lanadelumab approval by the FDA was originally on February 3, 2023, and it is now approved to prevent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adult and pediatric patients 2 years and older. FDA approval was supported by data from HELP Study, the\u00a0 HELP OLE Study and the Phase 3 SPRING Study (NCT SHP643-301). Lanadelumab is a plasma kallikrein inhibitor (monoclonal antibody)."}

{"Question": "What is Orladeyo used for?", "Answer": "Orladeyo is a treatment for hereditary angioedema (HAE) to help reduce the number of angioedema attacks in adults and children at least 12 years old. Orladeyo works by blocking a protein called kallikrein which results in a reduction of swelling and inflammation in hereditary angioedema. Orlando capsules are taken once daily. Hereditary angioedema is a rare and potentially life-threatening genetic disorder that causes an attack of rapid swelling in the face, throat, arms, legs or around the abdomen. Orladeyo is not used for treating an HAE attack that has already begun. In people with hereditary angioedema, overactive kallikrein increases levels of bradykinin, a protein that causes blood vessels to widen and leak. This leads to the swelling and inflammation of angioedema attacks. By inhibiting kallikrein, Orladeyo reduces the frequency of angioedema attacks. Orladeyo mechanism of action is as a plasma kallikrein inhibitor, it binds to plasma kallikrein which decreases plasma kallikrein activity to control excess bradykinin generation in patients with HAE. Orladeyo (berotralstat) is from a group of medicines called kallikrein inhibitors."}

{"Question": "What is Ingrezza used for?", "Answer": "Ingrezza (valbenazine) is used to treat tardive dyskinesia and chorea associated with Huntington's disease (HD), which are both body movement disorders. Ingrezza works by decreasing the amount of dopamine, in the nerve endings in the brain, which helps control body movements. Ingrezza is from a class of medicines called VMAT2 inhibitors , as it inhibits the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in neurons. This medicine controls the symptoms of movement disorders but does not cure the conditions. Tardive dyskinesia is a nervous system disorder that causes repetitive, uncontrolled muscle movements, usually in the face (chewing, lip smacking, frowning, tongue movement, blinking, or eye movement). Tardive dyskinesia is often caused by long-term treatment with certain psychiatric medications. Chorea is a movement disorder that results in sudden involuntary movements. It can be caused by Huntington's disease (an inherited disease that causes the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain). Ingrezza became an FDA-approved medicine on April 11, 2017, for adults with tardive dyskinesia, and on August 18, 2023, and it became approved for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease. The chorea associated with Huntington's disease approval was based on positive results from the\u00a0 KINECT-HD Phase 3 study and the ongoing KINECT-HD2 that showed an improvement in chorea severity with a statistically significant greater improvement in Total Maximal Chorea (TMC) score when compared to placebo. Ingrezza is available as capsules and Sprinkle capsules. The Ingrezza Sprinkle capsule can be opened and its contents sprinkled on soft food. This makes it easier to take for people who have difficulty swallowing capsules or for patients who prefer not to take capsules."}

{"Question": "What is Oxtella XR used for?", "Answer": "Oxtellar XR (oxcarbazepine) is a once-a-day anticonvulsant drug used to treat partial-onset seizures in people with epilepsy. Oxtellar XR is an extended-release tablet, which means it slowly releases the drug steadily over the course of the day. After you take Oxtellar XR, your body processes the drug into an active form called licarbazepine - a metabolite - that is responsible for most of Oxtellar XR's antiepileptic activity. Oxcarbazepine undergoes a process called metabolism to produce licarbazepine, its active 10-monohydroxy metabolite (MHD). Oxtellar XR works to help prevent seizure spread in the intact brain. During a seizure many neurons or nerve cells fire at the same time, creating a surge of excessive electrical activity. Oxtellar XR is thought to work by blocking voltage-sensitive sodium channels (VSSC). VSSC are integral membrane proteins that play key roles in the electrical signaling of cells. It's thought that by blocking VSSC, Oxtellar XR helps to stabilize hyper-excited nerve cell membranes, stop repetitive neuronal firing and diminish impulses between nerve cells. Oxtellar XR also affects calcium channels and increases potassium conductance, and this may also contribute to its antiepileptic activity. Oxtellar XR was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012. No generic versions of Oxteallar XR are available."}
