14,Agamree,"Agamree (vamorolone) is a novel corticosteroid used to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) to help improve motor function. Agamree works to reduce inflammation by blocking the production of proteins (cytokines) that cause inflammation. As well as improving motor function Agamree also has potentially less side effects on bone health, growth rate, and behavior.Â  Agamree is an oral suspension that is given once a day. Agamreeâs active ingredient, vamorolone, has anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects that works (mechanism of action) through the glucocorticoid receptor, although the exact way it works for DMD is unknown. Agamree received FDA approval on October 26, 2023, for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients 2 years of age and older.Â  Approval was based on results from Study 1 (NCT03439670), which showed Agamree was a safe and effective treatment for boys with DMD.","Vaccination: Immunizations should be up-to-date according to immunization guidelines before starting therapy with Agamree. Live-attenuated or live vaccines should be administered at least 4 to 6 weeks before starting Agamree. Inform patients and caregivers that they may receive concurrent vaccinations with the use of Agamree, except for live-attenuated or live vaccines. Stopping treatment: Do not stop taking Agamree abruptly or without first checking with your healthcare providers, as there may be a need for gradual dose reductions to decrease the risk of adrenal insufficiency crisis. Hyperglycemia: Corticosteroids can increase blood glucose, worsen pre-existing diabetes, predispose those on long-term therapy to diabetes mellitus, and may reduce the effect of anti-diabetic drugs. Patients with Altered Thyroid Function: Clearance of corticosteroids is decreased in hypothyroid patients and increased in hyperthyroid patients. Changes in the thyroid status of the patient may require a dose change of corticosteroid. Pheochromocytoma Crisis: In patients with suspected or identified pheochromocytoma, consider the risk of pheochromocytoma crisis prior to administering corticosteroids. Immunosuppression and increased risk of infection: Agamree suppresses the immune system and increases the risk of viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic infections. Gastrointestinal Perforation: There is an increased risk of gastrointestinal perforationÂ  when corticosteroids are used in patients with certain gastrointestinal disorders. Growth and Development Long-term use of corticosteroids can have negative effects on growth and development in children.","Do not take Agamree if you are allergic or have hypersensitivity to the active ingredient vamorolone or any of the inactive ingredients. Talk to your healthcare provider if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. There are no data on the use of Agamree during pregnancy.Â  Corticosteroids, in general, should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born to mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Agamree is indicated for use in the treatment of DMD, which is a disease of young male patients. Talk to your healthcare provider if you are breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed while taking Agamree. There are no data on the presence of vamorolone in human milk or the effects on milk production. However, by taking corticosteroids, it will appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other unwanted effects. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the motherâs clinical need and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant. Agamree is indicated for use in the treatment of DMD, which is a disease of young male patients.","The most common Agamree side effects are cushingoid features, psychiatric disorders, vomiting , weight gain , and vitamin D deficiency, these side effects affected more than 10% of patients and more than the placebo group. Serious Agamree side effects include:"

Deutetrabenazine is not a cure for Huntington's disease and will not treat other symptoms of this condition. Austedo is also used in adults to treat symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (TD), a nervous system disorder. Tardive dyskinesia causes repetitive uncontrolled muscle movements, usually in the face (chewing, lip smacking, frowning, tongue movement, blinking or eye movement). Austedo belongs to a class of medications called vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors. It works by changing the activity of certain natural substances in the brain that affect nerves and muscles. Austedo is taken twice daily, and Austedo XR (extended-release tablet) is taken once daily.","QTc Prolongation This medicine may prolong the QT interval, but the degree of QT prolongation is not clinically significant when administered within the recommended dosage range.Â  Austedo XR and Austedo should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias associated with a prolonged QT interval.

63,Avsola,"Avsola (infliximab-axxq) is a monoclonal antibody drug used to treat certain inflammatory autoimmune diseases. Avsola is a biological drug and one of four biosimilars of Remicade (infliximab). Biosimilars are highly similar versions of a drug that are designed to have the same effect, but they are not identical to the original version of the drug. Avsola works the same as other versions of infliximab and blocks the damage caused by too much tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Avsola binds to TNF-alpha, which prevents it from interacting with its receptors and activating certain processes in your body. TNF-alpha is a protein and inflammatory cytokine produced by your body, which plays an important role in your normal immune response. It is involved in your inflammatory response, and helps to fight off infection and cancer. Some people produce too much TNF-alpha, however, and this can cause an autoimmune disease to develop. Avsola was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2019, more than 20 years after the original version of infliximab - Remicade - was approved.","Avsola may cause serious side effects, including: 1. Risk of infection Avsola is a medicine that affects your immune system. Avsola can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections.

85,Benlysta,"Benlysta is used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis to help reduce lupus disease activity and the risk of severe lupus flares. This may lower damage to muscles, joints, skin, kidneys, and other organ systems. Benlysta infusion and subcutaneous injection are used with other medicines, which helps decrease lupus disease activity more than when other medicines are used alone. Benlysta injection is a biologic therapy that targets an underlying cause of lupus by working in the immune system. It is not a steroid medicine. B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) is a protein that stimulates the growth of B cells (a type of white blood cell in the immune system), which may worsen lupus symptoms. Benlysta works by blocking the BLyS protein which reduces the growth of B cells to help improve lupus symptoms. Benlysta is called a BLyS-specific inhibitor. Benlysta is available for subcutaneous injection using an autoinjector or prefilled syringe, and it is also available as an intravenous infusion.","Some people have had serious or fatal allergic reactions to Benlysta within hours or days after an injection. Tell your doctor right away if you have symptoms such as headache, anxiety, rash, itching, swelling in your face or throat, nausea, trouble breathing, and feeling dizzy or light-headed.

Your family or other caregivers should also be alert to changes in your mood or symptoms. Belimumab may affect the immune system of your baby if you use this medicine while you are pregnant. Use effective birth control to prevent pregnancy while you are using Benlysta and for at least 4 months after your last dose. Tell your doctor if you become pregnant. Belimumab may affect your baby's immune system, but having SLE during pregnancy may cause complications such as worsened lupus, eclampsia (dangerously high blood pressure ), premature birth, miscarriage, or growth problems in the unborn baby. SLE in the mother may also cause lupus or heart problems to develop in the newborn. The benefit of treating SLE may outweigh any risks to the baby. If you become pregnant while taking Benlysta, thereÂ is a pregnancy exposure registry that evaluates pregnancy outcomes in women with lupus exposed to it during pregnancy. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to refer patients and pregnant women are encouraged to enroll themselves by calling 1-877-311-8972 or visiting https://mothertobaby.org/ongoing-study/benlysta-belimumab/.

Briviact works in the brain to help control seizures and is thought to target a specific protein called SV2A that helps nerve cells communicate with each other. By attaching to this protein, Briviact helps balance the brain's electrical activity and this mechanismÂ can stop the sudden bursts of electricity that cause seizures. Briviact gained FDA approval on February 18, 2016. There is currently no Briviact generic available.",No warnings section found.,"You should not use Briviact if you are allergic to brivaracetam, Briviact, or any of the inactive ingredients in the formulation you are taking/receiving.

111,Brukinsa,"Brukinsa (zanubrutinib) is a targeted treatment that is FDA-approved to treat adults with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), or WaldenstrÃ¶m's macroglobulinemia (WM). It may also be given to treat adults with the following conditions under the accelerated approval scheme; continued approval may be contingent upon clinical trial results: Brukinsa directly inhibits an enzyme, called Brutonâs tyrosine kinase (BTK), by forming a covalent bond with a cysteine residue on the enzyme, preventing its activity. BTK works as a signaling molecule for the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. Activation of these pathways causes the proliferation of B cells and other interactions, and inhibition has been shown to reduce the growth and spread of malignant B cells. The ALPINE trial -- the first head-to-head phase 3 comparison trial of Brukinsa versus Imbruvica to be conducted -- reported Brukinsa was more effective than Imbruvica for progression-free survival in previously treated patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. Brukinsa also demonstrated a favorable cardiac safety profile with significantly lower rates of atrial fibrillation/flutter (5.2% vs. 13.3%) and no deaths due to cardiac disorders (vs 1.9% deaths with Imbruvica). Brukinsa was first approved in 2019 for MCL, and subsequent approvals for other indications followed.","Serious hemorrhage , including intracranial or gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hematuria, and hemothorax has occurred in people receiving Brukinsa, 0.3% have been fatal. 30% of people reported bleeding of any grade, excluding purpura and petechiae. Coadministration with antiplatelet or anticoagulants may increase the risk. Your doctor will monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding and discontinue if intracranial hemorrhage occurs. They may consider withholding Brukinsa for 3 to 7 days pre and post surgery depending on the risk of bleeding. Report any signs of excessive bleeding to your doctor. Brukinsa affects your immune system . Serious bacterial, viral, or fungal infections have been reported with Brukinsa; 2.9% were fatal and 24% were Grade 3 or higher. Reactivation of hepatitis B has also occurred. Consider prophylaxis for herpes simplex virus, pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and other infections in patients who are at increased risk for infections. Monitor yourself for fever or other signs and symptoms of infection and report them to your doctor. Blood count abnormalities , including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, have occurred in people receiving Brukinsa. Your doctor will perform regular blood counts and interrupt treatment, reduce the dose, or discontinue treatment as warranted. Serious cardiac arrhythmias , including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, have been reported in patients treated with Brukinsa. The risk is more likely in those with cardiac risk factors, high blood pressure, and acute infections.Â  Monitor yourself for signs and symptoms of cardiac arrhythmias (such as palpitations, dizziness, dizziness when standing, and shortness of breath) and report these to your doctor immediately. Liver problems which may be severe or life-threatening, or lead to death, can happen in people treated with Brukinsa. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to check your liver before and during treatment.

142,Cefuroxime,"Treatment of AOM caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae (including Î²-lactamase-producing strains), Moraxella catarrhalis (including Î²-lactamase-producing strains), or S. pyogenes . When anti-infectives indicated, AAP recommends high-dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin and clavulanate as drugs of choice for initial treatment of AOM; certain cephalosporins (cefdinir, cefpodoxime, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone) recommended as alternatives for initial treatment in penicillin-allergic patients without a history of severe and/or recent penicillin-allergic reactions. Treatment of pharyngitis and tonsillitis caused by S. pyogenes (group A Î²-hemolytic streptococci). Generally effective in eradicating S. pyogenes from nasopharynx; efficacy in prevention of subsequent rheumatic fever not established. AAP, IDSA, AHA, and others recommend a penicillin regimen (10 days of oral penicillin V or oral amoxicillin or single dose of IM penicillin G benzathine) as treatments of choice for S. pyogenes pharyngitis and tonsillitis; other anti-infectives (oral cephalosporins, oral macrolides, oral clindamycin) recommended as alternatives in penicillin-allergic patients. If an oral cephalosporin used, 10 day regimen of first generation cephalosporin (cefadroxil, cephalexin) preferred instead of other cephalosporins with broader spectrums of activity (e.g., cefaclor, cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefuroxime). Parenteral treatment of bone and joint infections caused by susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (including penicillinase-producing strains). Parenteral treatment of meningitis caused by susceptible S. pneumoniae , H. influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Neisseria meningitidis , or S. aureus (including penicillinase-producing strains). Not a drug of choice for meningitis; treatment failures have been reported, especially in meningitis caused by H. influenzae . In addition, bacteriologic response to cefuroxime appears to be slower than that reported with ceftriaxone, which may increase the risk for hearing loss and neurologic sequelae. When a cephalosporin is indicated for the treatment of bacterial meningitis, a parenteral third generation cephalosporin (usually ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) generally recommended. Treatment of acute maxillary sinusitis caused by susceptible S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae (non-Î²-lactamase-producing strains only). Data insufficient to date to establish efficacy for treatment of acute maxillary sinusitis known or suspected to be caused by Î²-lactamase-producing strains of H. influenzae or M. catarrhalis . Because of variable activity against S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae , IDSA no longer recommends second or third generation oral cephalosporins for empiric monotherapy of acute bacterial sinusitis. Oral amoxicillin or amoxicillin and clavulanate usually recommended for empiric treatment. If an oral cephalosporin used as an alternative in children (e.g., in penicillin-allergic individuals), combination regimen that includes a third generation cephalosporin (cefixime or cefpodoxime) and clindamycin (or linezolid) recommended. Treatment of secondary bacterial infections of acute bronchitis caused by susceptible S. pneumoniae , H. influenzae (non-Î²-lactamase-producing strains only), or H. parainfluenzae (non-Î²-lactamase-producing strains only). Treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis caused by susceptible S. pneumoniae , H. influenzae (non-Î²-lactamase-producing strains only), or H. parainfluenzae (non-Î²-lactamase-producing strains only). Parenteral treatment of lower respiratory tract infections (including pneumonia) caused by susceptible S. pneumoniae , S. aureus (including penicillinase-producing strains), S. pyogenes (group A Î²-hemolytic streptococci), H. influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Escherichia coli , or Klebsiella . Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Recommended by ATS and IDSA as an alternative for treatment of CAP caused by penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae . Also recommended as an alternative in certain combination regimens used for empiric treatment of CAP. Select regimen for empiric treatment of CAP based on most likely pathogens and local susceptibility patterns; after pathogen is identified, modify to provide more specific therapy (pathogen-directed therapy). For empiric outpatient treatment of CAP when risk factors for drug-resistant S. pneumoniae are present (e.g., comorbidities such as chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease, diabetes, alcoholism, malignancies, asplenia, immunosuppression; use of anti-infectives within the last 3 months), ATS and IDSA recommend monotherapy with a fluoroquinolone active against S. pneumoniae (moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin) or, alternatively, a combination regimen that includes a Î²-lactam active against S. pneumoniae (high-dose amoxicillin or fixed combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid or, alternatively, ceftriaxone, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime) given in conjunction with a macrolide (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin) or doxycycline. Cefuroxime and cefpodoxime may be less active against S. pneumoniae than amoxicillin or ceftriaxone. If a parenteral cephalosporin is used as an alternative to penicillin G or amoxicillin for treatment of CAP caused by penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae , ATS and IDSA recommend ceftriaxone, cefotaxime or cefuroxime; if an oral cephalosporin is used for treatment of these infections, ATS and IDSA recommend cefpodoxime, cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefdinir, or cefditoren. Parenteral treatment of septicemia caused by susceptible S. aureus (including penicillinase-producing strains), S. pneumoniae , E. coli , H. influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), or Klebsiella . In the treatment of known or suspected sepsis or the treatment of other serious infections when the causative organism is unknown, concomitant therapy with an aminoglycoside may be indicated pending results of in vitro susceptibility tests. Oral treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by susceptible S. aureus (including Î²-lactamase-producing strains) or S. pyogenes . Parenteral treatment of skin and skin structure infections caused by susceptible S. aureus (including Î²-lactamase-producing strains), S. pyogenes , E. coli , Klebsiella , or Enterobacter . Oral treatment of uncomplicated UTIs caused by susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae . Parenteral treatment of UTIs caused by susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae . Has been used orally or parenterally for treatment of uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal gonorrhea caused by susceptible Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Has been used parenterally for treatment of disseminated gonococcal infections caused by susceptible N. gonorrhoeae . Not included in current CDC recommendations for gonococcal infections. Because of concerns related to recent reports of N. gonorrhoeae with reduced susceptibility to cephalosporins, CDC states that oral cephalosporins no longer recommended as first-line treatment for uncomplicated gonorrhea. For treatment of uncomplicated urogenital, anorectal, or pharyngeal gonorrhea, CDC recommends a combination regimen that includes a single dose of IM ceftriaxone and either a single dose of oral azithromycin or 7-day regimen of oral doxycycline. Treatment of early Lyme disease manifested as erythema migrans. IDSA, AAP, and other clinicians recommend oral doxycycline, oral amoxicillin, or oral cefuroxime axetil as first-line therapy for treatment of early localized or early disseminated Lyme disease associated with erythema migrans, in the absence of specific neurologic involvement or advanced atrioventricular (AV) heart block. Treatment of early neurologic Lyme disease â  [off-label] in patients with cranial nerve palsy alone without evidence of meningitis (i.e., those with normal CSF examinations or those for whom CSF examination is deemed unnecessary because there are no clinical signs of meningitis). Parenteral anti-infectives (IV ceftriaxone, IV penicillin G sodium, or IV cefotaxime) recommended for treatment of early Lyme disease when there are acute neurologic manifestations such as meningitis or radiculopathy. Treatment of Lyme carditis â  [off-label] . IDSA and others state that patients with AV heart block and/or myopericarditis associated with early Lyme disease may be treated with an oral regimen (doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil) or a parenteral regimen (IV ceftriaxone or, alternatively, IV cefotaxime or IV penicillin G sodium). A parenteral regimen usually recommended for initial treatment of hospitalized patients; an oral regimen can be used to complete therapy and for the treatment of outpatients. Treatment of borrelial lymphocytoma â  [off-label] . Although experience is limited, IDSA states that available data indicate that borrelial lymphocytoma may be treated with an oral regimen (doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil). Treatment of uncomplicated Lyme arthritis â  [off-label] without clinical evidence of neurologic disease. An oral regimen (doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil) can be used, but a parenteral regimen (IV ceftriaxone or, alternatively, IV cefotaxime or IV penicillin G sodium) should be used in those with Lyme arthritis and concomitant neurologic disease. Patients with persistent or recurrent joint swelling after a recommended oral regimen should receive retreatment with the oral regimen or a switch to a parenteral regimen. Some clinicians prefer retreatment with an oral regimen for those whose arthritis substantively improved but did not completely resolve; these clinicians reserve parenteral regimens for those patients whose arthritis failed to improve or worsened. Allow several months for joint inflammation to resolve after initial treatment before an additional course of anti-infectives is given. Perioperative prophylaxis in patients undergoing cardiac surgery; a drug of choice for cardiac procedures (e.g., coronary artery bypass, pacemaker or other cardiac device insertion, ventricular assist devices). Perioperative prophylaxis in patients undergoing clean head and neck surgery involving placement of prosthesis (excluding tympanostomy); perioperative prophylaxis in conjunction with metronidazole in patients undergoing clean-contaminated cancer surgery of the head and neck or other clean-contaminated head and neck procedures (excluding tonsillectomy and functional endoscopic sinus procedures). A drug of choice. Has been used for perioperative prophylaxis in patients undergoing noncardiac thoracic surgery, GI or biliary tract surgery, gynecologic or obstetric surgery (e.g., vaginal hysterectomy), orthopedic procedures, or heart transplantation. Other anti-infectives (e.g., cefazolin) usually preferred.","Known hypersensitivity to cefuroxime or other cephalosporins. Possible emergence and overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms with prolonged therapy. Careful observation of the patient is essential. Institute appropriate therapy if superinfection occurs. Treatment with anti-infectives alters normal colon flora and may permit overgrowth of Clostridium difficile . C. difficile infection (CDI) and C. difficile -associated diarrhea and colitis (CDAD; also known as antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis or pseudomembranous colitis) reported with nearly all anti-infectives, including cefuroxime, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to development of CDAD; hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile are associated with increased morbidity and mortality since they may be refractory to anti-infectives and colectomy may be required. Consider CDAD if diarrhea develops during or after therapy and manage accordingly. Obtain careful medical history since CDAD may occur as late as 2 months or longer after anti-infective therapy is discontinued. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, discontinue anti-infectives not directed against C. difficile whenever possible. Initiate appropriate supportive therapy (e.g., fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation), anti-infective therapy directed against C. difficile (e.g., metronidazole, vancomycin), and surgical evaluation as clinically indicated. Possible hypersensitivity reactions, including rash (maculopapular or erythematous), pruritus, fever, eosinophilia, urticaria, anaphylaxis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue and institute appropriate therapy as indicated (e.g., epinephrine, corticosteroids, maintenance of an adequate airway and oxygen). Partial cross-sensitivity among cephalosporins and other Î²-lactam antibiotics, including penicillins and cephamycins. Prior to initiation of therapy, make careful inquiry concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins, penicillins, or other drugs. Cautious use recommended in individuals hypersensitive to penicillins: avoid use in those who have had an immediate-type (anaphylactic) hypersensitivity reaction and administer with caution in those who have had a delayed-type (e.g., rash, fever, eosinophilia) reaction. Used with caution in patients with a history of GI disease, particularly colitis. (See Superinfection/Clostridium difficile-associated Diarrhea and Colitis under Cautions.) Prolonged PT reported with some cephalosporins. Monitor PT in patients at risk, including those with renal or hepatic impairment, poor nutritional state, receiving prolonged therapy, or stabilized on anticoagulant therapy. Administer vitamin K when indicated. Periodically evaluate renal status during therapy, especially in seriously ill patients receiving maximum dosage. Caution if used concomitantly with nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides, potent diuretics). (See Interactions.) To reduce development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of cefuroxime and other antibacterials, use only for treatment or prevention of infections proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When selecting or modifying anti-infective therapy, use results of culture and in vitro susceptibility testing. In the absence of such data, consider local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns when selecting anti-infectives for empiric therapy. Mild to moderate hearing loss reported rarely in pediatric patients who received cefuroxime for treatment of meningitis. Persistence of positive CSF cultures at 18â36 hours reported; clinical importance unknown. Ceftin oral suspensions containing 125 or 250 mg of cefuroxime/5 mL contain aspartame (NutraSweet ), which is metabolized in the GI tract to provide 11.8 or 25.2 mg of phenylalanine/5 mL, respectively. Cefuroxime sodium contains approximately 54.2 mg (2.4 mEq) of sodium per g of cefuroxime. Category B. Distributed into milk; use with caution. Safety and efficacy of oral or parenteral cefuroxime not established in children <3 months of age. Other cephalosporins accumulate in neonates resulting in prolonged serum half-life. Safety and efficacy of oral cefuroxime for treatment of acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis in pediatric patients 3 months to 12 years of age have been established based on safety and efficacy of the drug in adults. In addition, use of oral cefuroxime in pediatric patients is supported by pharmacokinetic and safety data in adult and pediatric patients, clinical and microbiologic data from adequate and well-controlled studies of the treatment of acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis in adults and acute otitis media with effusion in pediatric patients, and postmarketing surveillance of adverse effects. Tablets should not be crushed for pediatric administration since the drug has a strong, persistent, bitter taste; vomiting was induced aversively in some children who received crushed tablets. The oral suspension should be used in children who cannot swallow tablets whole. To avoid overdosage, the commercially available Duplex drug delivery system containing 750 mg or 1.5 g of cefuroxime and 50 mL of dextrose injection in separate chambers should not be used in pediatric patients unless the entire 750-mg or 1.5-g dose is required. No overall differences in safety and efficacy in those â¥65 years of age compared with younger adults, but the possibility of increased sensitivity in some geriatric individuals cannot be ruled out. Substantially eliminated by kidneys; risk of toxicity may be greater in those with impaired renal function. Select dosage with caution; renal function monitoring may be useful because of age-related decreases in renal function. (See Renal Impairment under Dosage and Administration.) Possible decreased clearance and increased serum half-life. Dosage adjustments of parenteral cefuroxime necessary in patients with Cl cr â¤20 mL/minute.

201,Diastat,"Diastat AcuDial is a rectal gel used to treat seizures in people with epilepsy . Diastat AcuDial contains the medication diazepam, which belongs to a class of drugs called benzodiazepine anticonvulsant medications. Diastat AcuDial works by reducing the excitability of nerve cells or neurons in the brain. It does this by helping a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) work. GABA is a chemical messenger that blocks impulses between nerve cells. Diastat AcuDial is given via a rectal delivery system. The rectal delivery system combines a pre-filled syringe with a plastic applicator with a flexible, molded tip which is used to deliver the medication into the rectum. The syringe has a window on it that displays the dose and a green band that confirms when the dose is ready to be given. Diastat AcuDial contains the same gel formulation of diazepam as Diastat, which uses an older rectal delivery system that doesn't have a window displaying the dose of the medication. Diastat was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997. When the new delivery system - Diastat AcuDial - was approved in 2005, only the lowest strength pre-filled syringe of Diastat (containing diazepam 2.5mg/0.5ml) remained on the market. The higher strength versions of Diastat were discontinued at that time.",Diastat AcuDial may cause serious side effects including:,Do not use Diastat AcuDial if:,"Suddenly stopping or reducing the dose of Diastat AcuDial very quickly may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. In some cases, patients have developed withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months, including but not limited to: The most frequent side effect reported for Diastat AcuDial in clinical studies was somnolence (sleepiness or drowsiness). Other side effects included dizziness, headache, pain, abdominal pain, nervousness, vasodilation (increase in diameter of blood vessel), diarrhea, ataxia/incoordination (lack of coordination), euphoria (feeling of great happiness or well-being), asthma, rhinitis (irritation of the nose similar to an allergy or a cold), and rash.

241,Empaveli,"Empaveli (pegcetacoplan) is an immunosuppressant that is given by subcutaneous (under the skin) infusion, which may be used to treat adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). PNH is a rare acquired, life-threatening disease of the blood that is characterized by the destruction of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia), blood clots (thrombosis), and impaired bone marrow function. Empaveli works by binding to specific proteins in the complement system, which is a part of the immune system that enhances (or complements) the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear microbes and damaged cells from an organism, promote inflammation, and attack the pathogen's cell membrane. Empaveli binds to complement protein C3 and prevents it from splitting into C3a and C3b. This helps to stop intravascular hemolysis (IVH or the destruction of red blood cells in the circulation) and extravascular hemolysis (EVH or the breakdown of red blood cells in the spleen, bone marrow, or liver by macrophages). Empaveli is the only treatment that targets C3 and may prevent both forms of red blood cell destruction (IVH and EVH). It works higher in the complement system than other treatments used for PNH. Empaveli was FDA approved on May 14, 2021 and is only approved as PNH treatment. There is no Empaveli generic.","Empaveli can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections and increase your risk of developing serious and life-threatening infections, including meningitis caused by encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae; Neisseria meningitidis, types A, C, W, Y, and B; and Haemophilus influenzae type B.

246,Entresto,"Entresto is an oral combination prescription heart medication that contains two blood pressure-lowering medications: sacubitril and valsartan. Entresto is used to treat adults with long-lasting (chronic) heart failure to help reduce the risk of death and hospitalization and to treat certain children aged 1 year and older who have symptomatic heart failure. Entresto contains sacubitril and valsartan, which each have a different mechanism of action. Sacubitril works by blocking neprilysin, an enzyme that breaks down certain peptides in the body. This increases levels of beneficial peptides in the body which relax blood vessels and promote sodium and water excretion into the urine, reducing blood pressure. Valsartan blocks the effects of a hormone called angiotensin II, which can cause blood vessels to narrow and increase blood pressure. Entresto belongs to the class of medicines known as angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNi). Entresto gained FDA approval on July 7, 2015. Entresto is available as oral tablets and Entresto Sprinkle which can be sprinkled on food. Generic Entresto tablets are available under sacubitril and valsartan.",No warnings section found.,"Before taking Entresto, tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you: Do not use Entresto if you are pregnant.

251,Epinephrine,"Drug of choice in the emergency treatment of severe acute anaphylactic reactions, including anaphylactic shock. Used to relieve anaphylactic symptoms (e.g., urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, hypotension, respiratory distress) caused by reactions to drugs, contrast media, insect stings, foods (e.g., milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, peanuts, tree nuts), latex, or other allergens; also used for idiopathic or exercise-induced anaphylaxis. Administer immediately by IM injection as soon as anaphylaxis is diagnosed or strongly suspected. Administration by IM injection preferred, mainly because of safety considerations. However, IV administration may be necessary in extreme situations (e.g., anaphylactic shock, cardiac arrest, unresponsive or severely hypotensive patients who have failed to respond to multiple IM injections). Close hemodynamic monitoring is recommended during IV administration. Also used for its vasopressor effects in the treatment of anaphylactic shock and cardiac arrest associated with anaphylaxis. Manage cardiac arrest secondary to anaphylaxis with standard ACLS measures; consider alternative vasoactive drugs (e.g., vasopressin, norepinephrine) in patients who do not respond to epinephrine. (See ACLS and Cardiac Arrhythmias under Uses.) Consider other interventions (e.g., antihistamines, inhaled Î² 2 -adrenergic agents, IV corticosteroids) as clinically indicated. Risk of paradoxical response to epinephrine in patients receiving Î²-adrenergic blocking agents; consider glucagon and/or ipratropium for treatment of anaphylaxis in these patients. Used for its Î±-adrenergic effects to increase blood flow and facilitate return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) during cardiac arrest. Principal benefits of the drug result from increases in aortic diastolic blood pressure and in coronary and cerebral blood flow during resuscitation. High-quality CPR and defibrillation are the only proven interventions to increase survival to hospital discharge in ACLS. Other resuscitative efforts, including drug therapy, are considered secondary and should be performed without compromising the quality and timely delivery of chest compressions and defibrillation. Principal goal of pharmacologic therapy during cardiac arrest is to facilitate ROSC, and epinephrine is the drug of choice for this use. ACLS guidelines state that administration of epinephrine may be reasonable in adults with VF or pulseless VT resistant to initial CPR attempts and at least one defibrillation shock; optimal timing of administration (particularly in relation to defibrillation) not known and may vary based on patient-specific factors and resuscitation conditions. In adults with asystole or pulseless electrical activity (PEA), epinephrine may be administered as soon as feasible after onset of cardiac arrest. Also may be used in the postresuscitation period to optimize BP, cardiac output, and systemic perfusion after ROSC. Used during the periarrest period for treatment of symptomatic bradycardia in adults; although not a first-line drug, may be considered in patients who are unresponsive to atropine or as a temporizing measure while awaiting availability of a pacemaker. Also used in the emergency treatment of infants and children with bradycardia and cardiopulmonary compromise (with a palpable pulse) when bradycardia persists despite ventilation, oxygenation, and chest compressions. Drugs are rarely needed during resuscitation of neonates; because hypoxemia and inadequate lung inflation are common causes of bradycardia, establishing adequate ventilation is the most important corrective measure in these patients. Also has been used in the treatment of syncope resulting from AV nodal block. However, permanent pacemaker implantation is the treatment of choice for third-degree and advanced second-degree AV nodal block (complete heart block). Used for treatment of hypotension associated with septic shock, generally as a second-line agent. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign International Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock recommend norepinephrine as the first-line vasopressor of choice in adults with septic shock; if adequate BP not achieved, epinephrine may be added. Vasopressor therapy is not a substitute for replacement of blood, plasma, fluids, and/or electrolytes. Correct blood volume depletion as fully as possible before administration of epinephrine. Should not be used in cardiogenic shock (because it increases myocardial oxygen demand) or in hemorrhagic or traumatic shock. May be added to solutions of some local anesthetics to decrease the rate of vascular absorption (to localize and prolong the duration of anesthesia and decrease the risk of systemic toxicity). Has been applied topically to control superficial bleeding from arterioles or capillaries in the skin, mucous membranes, or other tissues. Bleeding from larger vessels is not controllable by topical application. Has been used to relax uterine musculature and inhibit uterine contractions in premature labor â  [off-label] (tocolysis); however, the cardiovascular and other adverse effects limit its usefulness. (See Pregnancy under Cautions.) Other Î²-agonists (e.g., terbutaline) preferred. Has been used as an oral bronchodilator for symptomatic treatment of asthma. However, an epinephrine preparation for oral inhalation no longer commercially available in US. While orally inhaled epinephrine was once widely used in the treatment of asthma, the drug has been replaced by more selective and rapid-acting agents (e.g., inhaled Î² 2 -adrenergic agonists). Also has been used IV for treatment of severe asthma exacerbations; however, no evidence that the drug improves outcomes compared with selective inhaled Î² 2 -adrenergic agonists. Has been used as an endoscopic treatment modality (as a dilute solution injected into and around ulcer base) to produce tamponade and achieve hemostasis in patients with acute nonvariceal upper GI bleeding â  [off-label] . Should not be used as monotherapy; use in combination with additional treatment modality (e.g., clips, thermocoagulation).","No absolute contraindications to use in life-threatening conditions. Relative contraindications include shock (other than anaphylactic and septic shock), known hypersensitivity to sympathomimetic amines, coronary insufficiency, or cardiac dilatation, as well as use in most patients with angle-closure glaucoma, or organic brain damage. Contraindicated for use during general anesthesia with agents such as cyclopropane and halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics (e.g., halothane). Contraindicated in conjunction with local anesthetics for use in certain areas (e.g.,fingers, toes, ears). Inadvertent induction of high arterial BP with epinephrine can cause angina pectoris, aortic rupture, or cerebral hemorrhage. Vasopressor therapy is not a substitute for replacement of blood, plasma, fluids, and/or electrolytes. Correct blood volume depletion as fully as possible before epinephrine administration. Avoid extravasation; severe local adverse effects (e.g., tissue necrosis) may occur as a result of local vasoconstriction. Check site of infusion frequently for free flow and observe infused vein for blanching. Avoid injection into leg veins, especially in geriatric patients or those with occlusive vascular diseases (e.g., arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, Buergerâs disease, diabetic endarteritis). If blanching is observed in the infused vein, changing the injection site periodically may be advisable. If extravasation occurs, infiltrate affected area liberally with 10â15 mL of sodium chloride solution containing 5â10 mg of phentolamine mesylate. Immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes occur if area is infiltrated within 12 hours; therefore, administer phentolamine as soon as possible after extravasation noted. Adverse reactions most likely to occur in hypertensive or hyperthyroid patients; use with extreme caution, if at all. Use with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus, pheochromocytoma, cardiovascular disease, or psychoneurotic disorders. Can induce serious cardiac arrhythmias in patients without heart disease, in those with organic heart disease, and in those with drug-induced myocardial sensitization. Can convert asystole to VF in anesthetic cardiac accidents since many anesthetics sensitize the myocardium to epinephrine. Cyclopropane or halogenated hydrocarbon general anesthetics that increase cardiac irritability and seem to sensitize the myocardium to epinephrine may cause arrhythmias including VPC, VT, or VF. (See Contraindications under Cautions.) Some formulations contain sulfites, which may cause allergic-type reactions (including anaphylaxis and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes) in certain susceptible individuals. Presence of sulfites in a parenteral epinephrine preparation and the possibility of allergic-type reactions should not deter use of the drug when indicated for the treatment of serious allergic reactions or for other emergency situations. Epinephrine is the preferred treatment for such conditions, and currently available alternatives to epinephrine may not be optimally effective. Consider that sulfites may be responsible for paradoxical worsening of respiratory function in asthmatics or for worsening symptoms or decreased bronchodilatory response with increasing use of the drug. Caution in those with a history of sensitivity to sympathomimetic amines. Can cause VF, but beneficial effects in restoring electrical activity and enhancing defibrillation are well documented. May cause tachycardia, ventricular ectopy, tachyarrhythmias, hypertension, and vasoconstriction in patients with a perfusing rhythm. Caution in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, organic heart disease). Extreme caution in patients with prefibrillatory rhythm because of excitatory cardiac activity. Overdosage or inadvertent IV administration may cause cerebrovascular hemorrhage secondary to a marked increase in BP. Caution in patients with long-standing bronchial asthma and substantial emphysema who may also have degenerative heart disease.

252,EpiPen,"EpiPen and Epipen Jr are used to treat life-threatening allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) to insect stings or bites, foods, drugs, and other allergens, and also treat exercise-induced anaphylaxis. EpiPen Auto-Injectors reduce wheezing and improve low blood pressure, hives, severe low blood pressure, and other symptoms of an allergic reaction. EpiPen contains epinephrine from a class of medications called sympathomimetic agents which works by relaxing the muscles in the airways and tightening the blood vessels. Epinephrine is also called adrenaline. EpiPen Auto-Injectors are hand-held devices that automatically inject a measured dose of medicine. EpiPen Auto-Injectors make it easier to give epinephrine in an emergency when anaphylaxis occurs. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and can happen within minutes and, if untreated, can lead to death. Each EpiPen or EpiPen Jr auto-injector can be used only 1 time (single-use). Patients with a history of severe allergic reactions should keep EpiPen or EpiPen Jr Auto-injectors on hand for immediate self-injection if they have an allergic reaction. Epipens are for emergency supportive therapy only and do not take the place of emergency medical care. You should get emergency help right away after using your EpiPen or EpiPen Jr auto-injector. EpiPen and EpiPen Jr auto-injectors have a Never-See-NeedleÂ® that covers the needle before and after you inject, so you should never see a needle. If you can see a needle, do not use the EpiPen or EpiPen Jr auto-injector.","EpiPen Auto-Injectors are used to treat severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis). Seek emergency medical attention even after you use EpiPen to treat a severe allergic reaction. You will need to receive further treatment and observation. Before using EpiPen a second time, tell your doctor if your first injection caused a serious side effect such as increased breathing difficulty, or dangerously high blood pressure (severe headache, blurred vision, buzzing in your ears, anxiety, confusion, chest pain, shortness of breath, uneven heartbeats, seizure). It is recommended that patients at risk of anaphylaxis carry 2 auto-injectors in case the first auto-injector is activated before the dose can be given, or you need a second dose. You may not know when anaphylaxis will happen. Talk to your healthcare provider if you need more auto-injectors to keep at work, school, or other locations. Make sure your family members, caregivers, and others where you keep your EpiPen or EpiPen Jr auto-injectors and they know how to use it before you need it. You may be unable to speak in an allergic emergency. A âtrainer penâ is available to teach and practice giving an injection. The trainer pen contains no medicine and no needle.","Before using EpiPen, tell your doctor if any past use has caused an allergic reaction to get worse. To make sure this medicine is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: Having an allergic reaction while pregnant or nursing could harm both mother and baby. You may need to use EpiPen during pregnancy or while you are breastfeeding. Seek emergency medical attention right away after using the injection. Epinephrine is the first-line medication of choice for the treatment of anaphylaxis during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Epinephrine should be used for the treatment of anaphylaxis during pregnancy and breastfeeding in the same manner as it is used in non-pregnant and non-breastfeeding patients. If possible during an emergency, tell your medical caregivers if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.","Before using EpiPen, tell your doctor if any past use has caused an allergic reaction to get worse. Call your doctor at once if you notice pain, swelling, warmth, redness, or other signs of infection around the area where you gave an injection. Side effects may be more likely in older adults.

In postmenopausal women, this is the main source of estrogen, unlike premenopausal women whose main source of estrogen is the ovaries. This mechanism of action of exemestane cuts off the estrogen supply that breast cancer cells need to grow , lowering estrogen levels, and preventing the growth and spread of breast cancer cells. Exemestane gained FDA approval on October 21, 1999, under the brand name Aromasin.

Exemestane may cause the following serious side effects. Bone loss and decreases in bone mineral density . Because exemestane decreases the amount of estrogen in your body, this can reduce your bone mineral density (BMD) over time, putting you at increased risk for bone fractures or weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis). Low vitamin D levels will also contribute to bone loss. Your doctor will do blood tests to check your vitamin D level and bone density before starting treatment with exemestane and regularly throughout treatment. Women with osteoporosis or with other risk factors for osteoporosis are more at risk. Harm to an unborn baby .

Fexofenadine works selectively on histamine-1 receptors that are located in our body, but not in our central nervous system - these are called peripheral histamine receptors. Because it acts on these receptors, fexofenadine is much less likely to cause drowsiness compared with some older antihistamines. Histamine is a chemical that is released by mast cells in response to an allergen, and it is responsible for many allergy symptoms, such as watery eyes, a runny nose, sneezing, and itching. Fexofenadine binds to histamine receptors and prevents histamine from having an effect on those receptors, which reduces allergy symptoms. There are many brands and forms of fexofenadine available. Fexofenadine was FDA approved in 1996.","Do not take fexofenadine with fruit juice (such as apple, orange, or grapefruit).","You should not use fexofenadine if you are allergic to it.

294,Finasteride,"Finasteride tablets are used for hair loss in men (androgenetic alopecia), to help improve hair growth and hair count over time. Finasteride is also used for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men with an enlarged prostate to improve urinary symptoms by reducing prostate size, and may delay the need for surgery. Finasteride is only available as a prescription medicine. In male-pattern hair loss, a hormone called DHT (dihydrotestosterone) causes hair to become shorter and finer and eventually stop growing in the affected area. DHT also causes the prostate to grow larger. Finasteride works by reducing the amount of DHT available by blocking an enzyme called 5Î±-reductase, which converts testosterone into DHT. Lower levels of DHT help improve hair growth in male pattern hair loss and reduce symptoms of BPH. Finasteride is from a class of medicines called 5Î±-reductase inhibitors. Finasteride 5mg tablets are used to treat symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men, and finasteride 1mg tablets are used to treat male pattern hair loss in men. Finasterideâs first FDA approval was under the brand name Proscar (finasteride 5mg tablets) on June 19, 1992, for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men with an enlarged prostate. Propecia (finasteride 1 mg tablets) became FDA-approved for male pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) in men on December 19, 1997. Finasteride is now available as a generic medicine. Topical finasteride for hair loss has been tested in clinical trials for men with male pattern hair loss, with results showing it to have a similar effect of improving hair count as oral finasteride tablets. The study used a topical solution of finasteride 0.25% w/w (concentration of 2.275âmg/mL) and was a randomized, doubleâblind, double-dummy, parallelâgroup, 24âweek study.

Fluconazole may also be used to prevent fungal infections in people with a weak immune system caused by cancer or cancer treatment including radiation therapy, bone marrow transplant, conditions such as AIDS, or children on life support (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]). Fluconazole works by targeting a key enzyme (lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase) responsible for building a crucial cell wall component (ergosterol) in fungi. By blocking this enzyme, Fluconazole prevents the fungus from forming a normal cell wall, leading to the buildup of abnormal sterols. These abnormal sterols weaken the fungal cell wall, hindering its growth. Fluconazole's mechanism of action means it has a much greater effect on this enzyme in fungi compared to the same enzyme in human cells. This selectivity helps minimize side effects. Fluconazole was first FDA approved on January 29, 1990. Brand names for fluconazole include Diflucan and generic fluconazole is available.",No warnings section found.,"Do not take fluconazole if you are allergic to fluconazole, Diflucan, other azole antifungals (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, or voriconazole), or any inactive ingredients in the fluconazole preparations.

312,Fluorouracil,"Treatment of adenocarcinoma of the colon, rectum, breast, stomach, and pancreas. Adjunct to surgery for the treatment of various solid tumors (e.g., adenocarcinoma of the colon, rectal carcinoma). Drug of choice (combined with leucovorin or levoleucovorin and other drugs [e.g., irinotecan, oxaliplatin]) for advanced colorectal cancer in the adjuvant or metastatic setting. Doublet regimens (i.e., fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and leucovorin or levoleucovorin [FOLFOX]; fluorouracil, irinotecan, and leucovorin or levoleucovorin [FOLFIRI]; capecitabine and oxaliplatin [CapeOx; CapOx]) are the current standard of care for the adjuvant or palliative treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. Fluorouracil combined with leucovorin or levoleucovorin is an acceptable treatment option in limited-resource settings or in patients unable to tolerate a doublet regimen. Weekly schedule of fluorouracil/leucovorin (high-dose leucovorin or Roswell Park regimen) has equal efficacy as monthly schedule (low-dose or Mayo Clinic schedule), but the weekly schedule is a preferred regimen for adjuvant therapy because of ease of use and less toxicity. (See Colorectal Cancer under Dosage and Administration.) Bimonthly, continuous IV infusion schedule of fluorouracil/leucovorin (LV5FU2 or deGramont regimen) also evaluated as adjuvant therapy and shown to be safer than direct IV injection regimen of these drugs. Simplified version of this regimen also evaluated. (See Colorectal Cancer under Dosage and Administration.) Role of regional adjuvant therapy (e.g., portal vein or hepatic artery infusion â  [off-label] ) for liver metastases requires further elucidation. Leucovorin and levoleucovorin enhance cytotoxicity, potentiate fluorouracil antineoplastic activity, and improve response for advanced colorectal carcinoma treatment. Leucovorin and levoleucovorin may potentiate risk of fluorouracil GI toxicity (e.g., diarrhea, nausea, stomatitis, vomiting) and myelosuppression. Combined with other drugs (e.g., cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, methotrexate) as an adjunct to surgery and for metastatic breast cancer. Decision regarding use of adjuvant endocrine therapy with or without sequential combination chemotherapy may be guided by prognostic tools, such as recurrence score based on 21-gene assay results, to predict absolute benefit of combination chemotherapy in addition to adjuvant endocrine therapy. Adjunct to surgery, may improve outcome. Has been used alone and in combination therapy (e.g., with cisplatin) for the treatment of localized or advanced esophageal cancer â  [off-label] . Has been used in combination chemotherapy for metastatic or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck â  [off-label] . Has been used in combination chemotherapy with radiation therapy for palliative treatment of unresectable locally advanced head and neck cancer, and for larynx preservation in locally advanced laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer. Used in combination with docetaxel and cisplatin as induction therapy prior to radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Has been used in combination with cisplatin concurrently with radiation therapy for invasive cervical cancer â  [off-label] . Metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer â  [off-label] . Has been used alone or in combination regimens for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma â  . Has been used for the treatment of carcinoid tumors â  . Has been used as second-line therapy in the treatment of ovarian epithelial cancer â  , including platinum-refractory disease. Also, cancers of the liver â  (e.g., hepatoblastoma â  ).","Manufacturer states none known. Acute early-onset or unusually severe toxicity may indicate near-complete or total absence of DPD activity; withhold or permanently discontinue fluorouracil in such patients. Certain homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the DPD gene result in complete or near-complete absence of DPD activity. Patients with such mutations are at increased risk for acute early-onset and severe, life-threatening, or fatal toxicity (e.g., mucositis, diarrhea, neutropenia, neurotoxicity). Patients with partial DPD activity also may have increased risk of severe, life-threatening, or fatal toxicity. Safety not established in patients with complete absence of DPD activity. Data insufficient to support dosage recommendations for those with partial DPD activity. Myocardial ischemia/infarction, heart failure, arrhythmias, and angina (including Prinzmetal variant angina) reported. Administration of drug by continuous IV infusion and presence of coronary artery disease may increase risk of cardiotoxicity. Safety of resuming fluorouracil after resolution of cardiotoxicity not established. Disorientation, confusion, ataxia, visual disturbances, and acute cerebellar syndrome reported. Insufficient data on risks of resuming fluorouracil after resolution of neurologic adverse effects. Hyperammonemic encephalopathy, in the absence of liver disease or other identifiable cause, reported. Altered mental status, confusion, disorientation, ataxia, or coma in presence of elevated serum ammonia concentrations, may occur â¤72 hours following initiation of fluorouracil infusion. If hyperammonemic encephalopathy or neurologic effects occur, temporarily interrupt therapy. Mucositis, stomatitis, and esophagopharyngitis and subsequent mucosal sloughing or ulceration reported more frequently following administration of the drug by direct IV injection compared with administration by continuous IV infusion. Diarrhea occurs frequently and may be severe. Temporarily withhold fluorouracil if grade 3 or 4 diarrhea or mucositis occurs; resume drug at a reduced dosage when the toxicity resolves or improves to grade 1. Potential for diarrhea to result in rapid clinical deterioration and death in patients receiving reduced folates (leucovorin, levoleucovorin) concomitantly; close monitoring is required. Initiate fluid and electrolyte replacement or antidiarrheal therapy as clinically necessary. Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (hand-foot syndrome) reported. Erythematous, desquamative rash that involves the hands and feet, may be accompanied by tingling sensation, pain, swelling, and erythema with tenderness. If grade 2 or 3 hand-foot syndrome occurs, temporarily interrupt therapy until the toxicity resolves or improves to grade 1. May be treated with oral pyridoxine therapy or topical emollients (e.g., hand creams, udder balm). Myelosuppression (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), sometimes severe or fatal, reported. Nadir neutrophil count usually occurs 9â14 days following initiation of therapy. Obtain complete blood cell counts (CBCs) prior to each treatment cycle, weekly (if administered on a weekly or similar schedule), and as clinically indicated. If grade 4 myelosuppression occurs, temporarily interrupt therapy until the toxicity resolves or improves to grade 1. May cause fetal harm. Advise women of childbearing potential and men with such female partners to use effective contraceptive methods during fluorouracil therapy and for up to 3 months after the last dose of the drug. If used during pregnancy or if patient becomes pregnant, apprise of potential fetal hazard. Results of animal studies suggest that fluorouracil may impair male and female fertility. Category D.

The 2 antivirals in Harvoni each have a different mechanism of action. Ledipasvir blocks the effects of an HCV protein called NS5A which is required for the virus to multiply (called viral replication). Harvoni also contains sofosbuvir, a prodrug, that is converted in the body to its active metabolite which uses an enzyme called NS5B RNA polymerase to incorporate itself into HCV RNA and acts as a chain terminator. This also prevents the virus from making copies of itself. Harvoni was FDA-approved on October 10, 2014. One strength of Harvoni is available as a generic: Harvoni 90 mg/400 mg (ledipasvir 90 mg/sofosbuvir 400 mg).

382,Heparin Sodium,"Treatment of DVT and PE. Recommended by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) as an appropriate choice of anticoagulant for initial treatment of acute proximal DVT or PE. LMWHs or fondaparinux generally preferred over heparin for initial treatment of acute venous thromboembolism; however, heparin may be preferred in patients with renal impairment. IV heparin also may be preferred over sub-Q therapies in patients with PE in whom thrombolytic therapy is being considered or if there is concern about adequate sub-Q absorption. After full-dose heparin therapy, warfarin or an LMWH generally is administered as follow-up anticoagulant therapy for â¥3 months in adults with venous thromboembolism. Prophylaxis of postoperative DVT and PE in patients undergoing general (e.g., abdominal) surgery who are at risk of thromboembolism. ACCP recommends pharmacologic (e.g., low-dose heparin) and/or nonpharmacologic/mechanical (e.g., intermittent pneumatic compression) methods of thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing general surgery, including abdominal, GI, gynecologic, and urologic surgery, according to the patientâs risk of thromboembolism and bleeding. In general, pharmacologic prophylaxis is recommended in patients with high (and possibly moderate) risk of venous thromboembolism who do not have a high risk of bleeding, while mechanical methods are suggested in patients who require thromboprophylaxis but have a high risk of bleeding. If pharmacologic prophylaxis is indicated in patients undergoing general surgery, ACCP states that an LMWH or low-dose heparin is preferred. ACCP states that the same recommendations for use of antithrombotic agents in general surgery patients can be applied to patients undergoing bariatric, vascular, and plastic/reconstructive surgery. Mechanical methods of prophylaxis generally recommended in patients undergoing cardiac surgery; however, ACCP states that low-dose heparin may be considered in cardiac surgery patients with a complicated postoperative course. Has been used for prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing craniotomy â  [off-label] ; however, benefits may be outweighed by possible increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. ACCP states that the addition of low-dose heparin to a mechanical method of prophylaxis may be considered in patients at very high risk of thromboembolism (e.g., those undergoing craniotomy for malignant disease) once adequate hemostasis established and risk of bleeding decreases. Also may be considered as a possible addition to mechanical prophylaxis in high-risk patients undergoing spinal surgery â  [off-label] (e.g., those with malignancy or those undergoing surgery with a combined anterior-posterior approach) once adequate hemostasis established and risk of bleeding decreases. Prevention of postoperative DVT and PE in patients undergoing major thoracic surgery. Pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis (e.g., low-dose heparin) recommended by ACCP in patients undergoing thoracic surgery who are at high risk of venous thromboembolism, provided risk of bleeding is low. Has been used for prevention of DVT and PE in patients undergoing total hip-replacement surgery â  [off-label] , total knee-replacement surgery â  [off-label] , or hip-fracture surgery â  [off-label] . ACCP recommends routine thromboprophylaxis (with a pharmacologic and/or mechanical method) in all patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery because of high risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism; continue thromboprophylaxis for at least 10â14 days, and possibly for up to 35 days after surgery. Among several antithrombotic agents (e.g., LMWH, fondaparinux, low-dose heparin, warfarin, aspirin) recommended for pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery, ACCP states LMWHs generally preferred; may consider alternative agents when an LMWH is not available or cannot be used. When selecting an appropriate thromboprophylaxis regimen, consider factors such as relative efficacy and safety of the drugs in addition to other logistics and compliance issues. Used for prevention of DVT and PE in acutely ill hospitalized medical patients and in those with medical conditions associated with a high risk of thromboembolism (e.g., cancer). In general, pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis recommended only in patients considered to be at high risk of venous thromboembolism. ACCP recommends anticoagulant prophylaxis (e.g., low-dose heparin) in acutely ill, hospitalized medical patients at increased risk of thrombosis who are not actively bleeding and do not have an increased risk of bleeding. Continued thromboprophylaxis suggested for 6â21 days until full mobility is restored or hospital discharge. Low-dose heparin also suggested by ACCP for pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in critically ill patients (e.g., those in an intensive care unit [ICU]) who are not actively bleeding and do not have risk factors for bleeding. Risk of venous thromboembolism is particularly high in patients with cancer. Use of low-dose heparin suggested by ACCP in cancer (solid tumors) outpatients who have additional risk factors for thromboembolism, provided risk of bleeding is low. Low-dose heparin may be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients with major trauma â  . For major trauma patients at high risk of venous thromboembolism, including those with acute spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, or spinal surgery for trauma, ACCP suggests the use of both a pharmacologic and mechanical method of prophylaxis, unless contraindications exist. Has been used for prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism during pregnancy; however, an LMWH generally is recommended by ACCP because of a more favorable safety profile. Has been used in combination with low-dose aspirin for prevention of recurrent pregnancy loss in women with antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) syndrome â  . Also has been used with aspirin (often combined with immune globulin) for prevention of venous thromboembolism and early pregnancy loss in women who have undergone in vitro fertilization â  . Has been used for treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism in neonates and children â  ; venous thromboembolism usually occurs secondary to an identifiable risk factor (e.g., presence of central venous access device) in such patients. Recommendations regarding use of antithrombotic therapy in children generally based on extrapolation from adult guidelines. In children with central venous catheters (or umbilical venous catheters) who experience venous thromboembolism, ACCP recommends removal of catheter if no longer functioning or required; at least 3â5 days of therapeutic anticoagulation suggested prior to removal. If such catheters must remain in place, ACCP suggests anticoagulant therapy until catheter is removed. Has been used to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients undergoing electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion â  for atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin may be used in patients in whom prolonged anticoagulation (e.g., with warfarin for â¥3 weeks) prior to cardioversion is not necessary or not possible; in these situations, heparin or an LMWH generally is administered at the time of transesophageal echocardiograph (TEE) or at presentation (for those with atrial fibrillation â¤48 hours) just prior to cardioversion. In patients with hemodynamic instability who require urgent cardioversion, ACCP suggests administration of IV heparin or an LMWH prior to cardioversion, if possible; however, such anticoagulant therapy must not delay any emergency intervention. Used during conversion to maintenance warfarin therapy to reduce the incidence of thromboembolism (e.g., stroke) in patients with prosthetic mechanical heart valves â  . ACCP suggests bridging anticoagulation (administration of an LMWH in either prophylactic or therapeutic dosages or IV heparin in prophylactic dosages) during the early postoperative period after insertion of a mechanical heart valve until patient is stable on warfarin therapy. Also may be used for bridging anticoagulation in patients with a mechanical heart valve in whom therapy with warfarin must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., for major surgery). ACC and AHA state that perioperative use of heparin should be considered for noncardiac surgery, invasive procedures, or dental procedures in patients with prosthetic heart valves who are at high risk for thrombosis without oral antithrombotic therapy (e.g., those with any mechanical mitral valve or a mechanical aortic valve with additional risk factors). Used for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with prosthetic mechanical heart valves â  . (See Thromboembolism During Pregnancy under Dosage and Administration.) Renal vein thrombosis â  is the most common cause of spontaneous venous thromboembolism in neonates. Although use of anticoagulant therapy in patients with renal vein thrombosis is controversial, heparin is suggested by ACCP as a possible treatment option in selected neonates. Used to reduce the extent of ischemic injury in patients with acute arterial emboli or thrombosis; however, ACCP states formal studies demonstrating improved outcomes have not been conducted. In patients with limb ischemia secondary to arterial emboli or thrombosis, immediate systemic anticoagulation with heparin to prevent thrombotic propagation is suggested by ACCP. Prophylaxis during cardiac catheterization via an artery in neonates and children. If femoral artery thrombosis occurs following cardiac catheterization, therapeutic-dose IV heparin is recommended, followed by subsequent conversion to an LMWH or continued treatment with heparin to complete 5â7 days of therapeutic anticoagulation. Prevention of activation of the coagulation mechanism during arterial and cardiac surgery. A nonheparin anticoagulant (e.g., bivalirudin) may be used in place of heparin in patients with acute heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or subacute HIT (platelets have recovered, but HIT antibodies still present) who require urgent cardiac surgery. Because HIT antibodies are transient, ACCP states that short-term use of heparin may be appropriate in patients with a remote (>3 months) history of HIT and no detectable antibodies who require cardiac surgery. Treatment of acute and chronic consumptive coagulopathies, including disseminated intravascular coagulation. Maintenance of patency of indwelling peripheral or central venipuncture devices designed for intermittent injections and/or blood sampling. ACCP suggests use of heparin flushes as an option for primary thromboprophylaxis of central venous access devices in children. In neonates and children with peripheral arterial catheters, ACCP recommends continuous IV infusion of heparin (in low concentrations) via the catheter for prophylaxis. Also may consider use of heparin for treatment if symptomatic catheter-related thromboembolism occurs. In neonates with umbilical arterial catheters, ACCP also suggests thromboprophylaxis with low-dose heparin via the catheter to maintain patency. Used in combination with antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin) during and after successful coronary artery reperfusion (e.g., thrombolytic agents) for prevention of ischemic complications of STEMI â  (e.g., death, reinfarction, stroke). The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and AHA state that patients with STEMI undergoing thrombolytic therapy should receive an anticoagulant (e.g., heparin, enoxaparin, fondaparinux) for â¥48 hours, and preferably for the duration of the index hospitalization, up to 8 days or until revascularization is performed. Enoxaparin is preferred over heparin if extended anticoagulation (>48 hours) is necessary. Used to reduce the risk of thrombotic complications in patients undergoing PCI. Used in conjunction with aspirin and other standard therapy (e.g., GP IIb/IIIa-receptor inhibitors, P2Y12 receptor antagonists). Use of a parenteral anticoagulant is recommended in patients undergoing PCI to prevent thrombus formation during the procedure. IV heparin is recommended by AHA, the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) as an appropriate choice of anticoagulant. Reduction in the risk of acute cardiac ischemic events (death and/or MI) in patients with NSTE ACS (unstable angina or non-ST-segment-elevation MI [NSTEMI]) â  . Used concurrently with aspirin and/or other standard therapy (e.g., nitrates, Î²-adrenergic blocking agents [Î²-blockers], P2Y12 receptor antagonists). Initial parenteral anticoagulants with established efficacy in patients with NSTE ACS include enoxaparin, heparin, bivalirudin (only in patients managed with an early invasive strategy), and fondaparinux. In patients who will undergo CABG, if heparin is already being administered, continue during surgery. If patient is receiving other anticoagulants (enoxaparin, fondaparinux, or bivalirudin), discontinue other anticoagulant and use heparin during CABG. In patients in whom conservative medical therapy is selected as a postangiographic management strategy, recommendations for continued antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy generally are based on the presence of CAD. May be used for treatment of acute cerebral venous sinus (sinovenous) thrombosis â  in adults. May convert to oral anticoagulant therapy once patient is stabilized. Recommended by ACCP as an option for initial anticoagulation in children with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis â  without substantial intracranial hemorrhage. Also has been suggested for use in such children with substantial hemorrhage. Heparin anticoagulants (i.e., LMWH or heparin) have been used for thromboprophylaxis in selected patients with acute ischemic stroke â  ; those with additional risk factors for venous thromboembolism are more likely to benefit. ACCP suggests thromboprophylaxis with an LMWH (in prophylactic dosages), sub-Q heparin, or intermittent pneumatic compression in patients with acute ischemic stroke â  and restricted mobility; LMWH is preferred over heparin. Prophylactic-dose heparin usually initiated within 48 hours of onset of stroke and continued throughout hospital stay until patient regains mobility; do not administer within the first 24 hours after thrombolytic therapy. Also has been used for initial management of acute arterial ischemic stroke in children â  until dissection and embolic causes have been excluded. In children with acute arterial ischemic stroke secondary to non-Moyamoya vasculopathy â  , ACCP recommends ongoing antithrombotic therapy (e.g., heparin) for 3 months. Heparin may be considered in neonates with a first episode of arterial ischemic stroke associated with a documented cardioembolic source. Used in the perioperative management of patients who require temporary interruption of long-term warfarin therapy for surgery or other invasive procedures. ACCP suggests perioperative use of an LMWH or IV heparin (bridging anticoagulation) in selected patients with venous thromboembolism, atrial fibrillation, or mechanical prosthetic heart valves depending on their risk of developing thromboembolism without warfarin therapy. In general, bridging anticoagulation is suggested in such patients who are considered to be at particularly high risk of venous thromboembolism without oral anticoagulant therapy. Used as an in vitro anticoagulant in blood transfusions. Used for anticoagulation during extracorporeal circulation and dialysis procedures.","Uncontrollable bleeding, unless such bleeding is secondary to disseminated intravascular coagulation. Severe thrombocytopenia, history of HIT, or HIT with thrombosis. Inability to perform suitable blood coagulation tests at required intervals in patients receiving full-dose therapy. Lack of such tests generally is not a contraindication for fixed low-dose therapy, since monitoring of coagulation tests usually is not required. Known hypersensitivity to heparin or pork products. (See Sensitivity Reactions under Cautions.) Hemorrhage can range from minor local ecchymoses to major hemorrhagic complications. Bleeding may occur at any site; some hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect. Use with extreme caution in patients with an increased risk of hemorrhage. Such patients include those with subacute bacterial endocarditis; ulcerative GI lesions; hemorrhagic blood dyscrasias (e.g., hemophilia, some vascular purpuras, thrombocytopenia); menstruation; hepatic disease with impaired hemostasis; severe hypertension; major surgery, especially involving the eye, brain, or spinal cord; continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine; and spinal tap or spinal anesthesia. Screen patients prior to treatment initiation to rule out bleeding disorders. Monitor patients with appropriate coagulation tests just prior to surgery. Discontinue therapy immediately if hemorrhage occurs or if coagulation tests are unduly prolonged. Nosebleed, hematuria, or tarry stools may be noted as the first sign of bleeding or overdosage. Easy bruising or petechiae may precede frank bleeding. If severe hemorrhage or overdosage occurs, administer protamine sulfate immediately. Blood transfusions may also be required following massive blood loss. If signs and symptoms of acute adrenal hemorrhage and insufficiency occur, measure plasma cortisol concentrations. Initiate vigorous therapy with IV corticosteroids after discontinuance. Do not delay initiation of corrective therapy until laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis, since any delay may be fatal. Perform periodic hematocrit and tests for occult blood in stool during the entire course of therapy. Obtain baseline aPTT value prior to insertion of an indwelling venipuncture device (e.g., heparin lock) since repeated injections of small doses of heparin sodium can alter aPTT results. Risk of thrombocytopenia, including HIT (immune-mediated reaction caused by development of IgG platelet-aggregating antibodies). (See HIT under Cautions and also see Contraindications under Cautions.) Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. Mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count >100,000/mm 3 ) may remain stable or reverse with continued therapy. If clinically important HIT occurs, discontinue the drug immediately and substitute a nonheparin anticoagulant (e.g., argatroban, bivalirudin). Generally contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to the drug. Patients with documented hypersensitivity should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Risk of HIT; may lead to severe thromboembolic complications including DVT, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, mesenteric thrombosis, renal artery thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities (possibly requiring amputation), MI, PE, stroke, and possibly, death. Can occur even with heparin lock flush solutions. Usually evident 5â10 days after exposure to heparin, but can occur more rapidly (e.g., within 24 hours) or as late as several weeks after discontinuance of therapy. If HIT with or without thrombosis is diagnosed or strongly suspected, discontinue all sources of heparin (including heparin flushes) and substitute a nonheparin anticoagulant (e.g., argatroban, bivalirudin). Initiate conversion to warfarin therapy only after substantial recovery from acute HIT has occurred (i.e., platelet counts â¥150,000/mm 3 ). The manufacturer recommends against future use of heparin in patients who experience HIT, particularly within 3â6 months following the event and if HIT antibodies are still present. Evaluate patients who develop thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after treatment discontinuance for HIT and HIT with thrombosis. Increased resistance to the antithrombotic effects of heparin reported; associated with fever, MI, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, thrombosis, antithrombin III deficiency, malignant neoplasms, and surgery (i.e., postoperatively). Fatal medication errors (including in pediatric patients) have occurred as a result of confusion between different formulations of heparin, in particular with heparin sodium injection and catheter lock flush vials. Ensure accuracy of dispensing; take appropriate measures to carefully distinguish between heparin formulations when dispensing and review all labels for correct drug name, strength, and volume. Report dispensing errors to manufacturers or directly to FDA MedWatch program by phone (800-FDA-1088), fax (800-FDA-1078), or internet ( [Web] ). Category C. Manufacturers recommend use of a preservative (benzyl alcohol)-free formulation in pregnant women. Not likely to be distributed into milk. However, if benzyl alcohol is present in maternal serum, it is likely to distribute into milk and be absorbed by a nursing infant. Caution is advised when using heparin in nursing women; manufacturers recommend use of a preservative (benzyl alcohol)-free formulation. ACCP recommends that heparin be continued in nursing women who are already receiving such therapy. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies evaluating use of heparin in pediatric patients. Some heparin sodium injections and heparin lock flush solutions contain benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Large amounts of benzyl alcohol (i.e., 100â400 mg/kg daily) have been associated with toxicity (e.g., âgasping syndromeâ) in neonates. Manufacturers recommend use of preservative-free formulations in neonates and infants. AAP states that presence of small amounts of this preservative in a commercially available injection should not proscribe its use when indicated in neonates. If other benzyl alcohol-containing preparations are being used, consider the total daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources. Fatal medication dispensing errors reported in pediatric patients, including neonates. Take appropriate precautions when dispensing and administering the drug. (See Dispensing and Administration Precautions under Cautions.) Because of the potential risk of systemic anticoagulation, avoid use of heparin lock flush solutions containing 100 units/mL in neonates and in infants <10 kg. Caution also advised when using heparin lock flush solutions containing 10 units/mL in premature infants <1 kg who are receiving frequent flushes. Manufacturers state that risk of hemorrhage may be higher in patients >60 years of age, particularly women. (See Geriatric Patients and see Women under Dosage and Administration.) Patients with renal failure may be at increased risk of bleeding complications.

406,Hydrocortisone,"Hydrocortisone cream is used to treat eczema, dermatitis, psoriasis , hemorrhoids , insect bites or stings, and other skin conditions to help relieve itchy or inflamed skin.Â  It is also available as hydrocortisone ointment, suppositories, gel, and lotion. Hydrocortisone is a steroid medicine that works by decreasing inflammation and reducing an overactive immune system. Hydrocortisone cream and skin products should only be used on skin conditions that respond to steroids. Hydrocortisone creams, suppositories, and other topical products may contain other active ingredients, including antibiotics neomycin and polymyxin B sulfate when used for inflamed, infected skin, or hydrocortisone with pramoxine for hemorrhoids. Hydrocortisone, hydrocortisone butyrate, and hydrocortisone acetate are different medicines. Hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1% (Locoid) is stronger or more potent than hydrocortisone 2.5%, 1% and 0.5%.Â  Hydrocortisone acetate and hydrocortisone are both mild steroids. Hydrocortisone ointment is used on very dry skin and creates a barrier to lock in moisture. This also helps the active ingredient penetrate the skin, so it is more potent than creams and lotions. Creams are easier to apply to the skin, are absorbed quickly, and help keep the skin moisturized. Lotions are lighter and easier to apply to large areas of the body, hairy areas, or weeping skin. Gels are often used on the scalp because they donât leave the hair greasy. Hydrocortisone tablets are used to treat asthma, allergic reactions , arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, adrenal insufficiency, lupus, certain cancers, and inflammatory conditions. It works to decrease inflammation, replace cortisol, or improve an overactive immune system.","Warnings for OTC hydrocortisone cream Do not use it in the eyes, for diaper rash, or for external genital or feminine itching if you have a vaginal discharge. Do not use more than the recommended daily dosage unless directed by a doctor Stop using this product and consult a doctor if your condition worsens or if symptoms persist for more than 7 days or clear up and occur again within a few days (do not continue to use this or any other hydrocortisone product for longer than 7 days, unless prescribed by a doctor). Stop using this product and consult a doctor if bleeding occurs due to anal itching. Prolonged use of topical corticosteroids may cause atrophy of the epidermis and subcutaneous tissue; these effects are most likely to occur (even with short-term use) in intertriginous (e.g., axilla, groin), flexor, and facial areas. If a skin infection develops or is present, anti-infective therapy should be started. If it does not respond promptly, discontinue topical corticosteroid therapy until the infection has been controlled. Warning for hydrocortisone tablets Hydrocortisone Tablets may suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection. Corticosteroid-associated infections can be mild but can be severe and, at times, fatal. The rate of infectious complications increases with increasing corticosteroid dosages. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may cause eye side effects, including posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves. It may also enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Kaposiâs sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic condition. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can elevate blood pressure, cause salt and water retention, and increase potassium excretion. Vaccinations. Administration of live or live, attenuated vaccines is contraindicated in patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids.Â Killed or inactivated vaccines may be administered to patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids; however, the response to such vaccines may be diminished. Indicated immunization procedures may be undertaken in patients receiving nonimmunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids.","You should not use hydrocortisone topical if you are allergic to it. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had: Steroid medicines can increase the glucose (sugar) levels in your blood or urine. Tell your doctor if you have diabetes . Pregnancy Tell your healthcare provider if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant or become pregnant as it is not known if hydrocortisone topical will harm an unborn baby. Breastfeeding Ask your healthcare provider if it is safe to breastfeed while using this medicine. You should not use hydrocortisone if you are allergic to hydrocortisone or corticosteroidsÂ or if you have a systemic fungal infection . Steroids can weaken your immune system, making it easier to get an infection or worsen an infection you already have. Tell your doctor about any illness or infection you had within the past several weeks. Tell your doctor if you have ever had: Long-term oral use of steroids may lead to bone loss (osteoporosis), especially if you smoke, do not exercise,Â  do not get enough vitamin D or calcium in your diet, or if you have a family history of osteoporosis.

407,Hydrocortisone (Topical),"Relief of inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. Nonprescription preparations used for temporary relief of minor skin irritations, itching, and rash caused by eczema, dermatitis, insect bites, poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, soaps, detergents, cosmetics, or jewelry. Nonprescription preparations used for temporary relief of itchy anal and/or genital areas. Nonprescription preparations used for temporary relief of itching and minor scalp irritation caused by scalp dermatitis. Generally most effective in acute or chronic dermatoses (e.g., seborrheic or atopic dermatitis, localized neurodermatitis, anogenital pruritus, psoriasis, late phase of allergic contact dermatitis, inflammatory phase of xerosis). Topical therapy generally preferred over systemic therapy; fewer associated adverse systemic effects. Topical therapy generally only controls manifestations of dermatoses; eliminate cause if possible. Topical efficacy may be increased by using a higher concentration or occlusive dressing therapy. (See Administration with Occlusive Dressing under Dosage and Administration.) Response may vary from one topical corticosteroid preparation to another. Anti-inflammatory activity may vary considerably depending on the vehicle, drug concentration, site of application, disease, and individual patient. Topical treatment of infected dermatoses in combination with topical anti-infectives (e.g., neomycin, polymyxin B) or antifungals. If a topical corticosteroid is used in combination with a topical anti-infective, weigh benefits against risks. (See Skin Infection under Cautions.) Hydrocortisone acetate paste used as an adjunct for temporary symptomatic relief of oral inflammatory or ulcerative lesions resulting from trauma. Used rectally as a retention enema for adjunctive treatment of mild or moderate acute ulcerative colitis limited to the rectosigmoid or left colon. Used rectally as a retention enema for mild acute ulcerative colitis of the transverse or descending colon. Retention enema usually is effective in mild or moderate acute rectosigmoid ulcerative colitis when response to sulfasalazine (generally considered the maintenance drug of choice) is inadequate or when sulfasalazine cannot be given. Systemic corticosteroids and/or corticosteroid enemas are more effective than sulfasalazine in acute ulcerative colitis attacks, but if surgery is required, it should not be delayed in favor of corticosteroid therapy. Hydrocortisone acetate rectal suppositories or suspension (foam), may be effective as adjunctive treatment of rectal ulcerative colitis. Hydrocortisone acetate rectal suppositories also are used in the treatment of other anorectal inflammatory conditions (e.g., inflamed hemorrhoids, postirradiation or factitial proctitis, cryptitis, pruritus ani). Fixed-combination preparations of a corticosteroid and local anesthetic may be useful for symptomatic relief of anorectal conditions (e.g., hemorrhoids), but combinations with antihistamines, astringents, keratolytics, and/or vasoconstrictors are of questionable efficacy.","Known hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone or any ingredient in the formulation. Rectal corticosteroid therapy in patients with intestinal obstruction, abscess, impending perforation, peritonitis, extensive fistulas, and fresh intestinal anastomoses or sinus tracts. Allergic contact dermatitis may manifest as failure to heal rather than irritation as occurs with other topical preparations that do not contain corticosteroids; confirm with diagnostic patch testing. Topically applied corticosteroids can be absorbed in sufficient amounts to reversibly suppress the HPA axis. Perform periodic HPA-axis evaluation by appropriate testing (e.g., ACTH stimulation, morning plasma cortisol, urinary free cortisol), especially in patients applying a topical corticosteroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion. If HPA-axis suppression occurs, withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, and/or substitute a less potent corticosteroid. HPA-axis function recovery generally is prompt and complete following drug discontinuance. Rarely, glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may require systemic corticosteroid therapy. Systemic absorption following topical administration may result in manifestations of Cushingâs syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. Adverse systemic effects may occur when corticosteroids are used on large areas of the body, for prolonged periods of time, with an occlusive dressing, and/or concurrently with other corticosteroid-containing preparations. Infants and children may be more susceptible to adverse systemic effects. (See Pediatric Use under Cautions.) Possible adverse local reactions (e.g., irritation, dryness, folliculitis, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, striae, miliaria); may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings, especially with prolonged therapy. Prolonged use of topical corticosteroids may cause atrophy of the epidermis and subcutaneous tissue; these effects are most likely to occur (even with short-term use) in intertriginous (e.g., axilla, groin), flexor, and facial areas. If irritation occurs, discontinue drug and initiate appropriate therapy. If concurrent skin infection is present or develops, initiate appropriate anti-infective therapy. If infection does not respond promptly, discontinue topical corticosteroid therapy until the infection has been controlled. When topical corticosteroids and topical anti-infectives are used concomitantly, consider that the corticosteroid may mask clinical signs of bacterial, fungal, or viral infections; prevent recognition of ineffectiveness of the anti-infective; or suppress hypersensitivity reactions to ingredients in the formulation. In addition, consider the cautions, precautions, and contraindications associated with the anti-infective. Do not use occlusive dressings in patients with primary skin infection. Some manufacturers state that topical corticosteroids are contraindicated in patients with tuberculosis of the skin, dermatologic fungal infections, and cutaneous or systemic viral infection (including vaccinia and varicella and herpes simplex of the eye or adjacent skin); however, most clinicians believe topical corticosteroids may be used with caution if the infection is treated. Use rectally with caution in severe ulcerative disease and only after adequate proctologic examination; risk of intestinal perforation. Adverse systemic corticosteroid effects may occur with use of occlusive dressings on large areas of the body and for prolonged periods of time; monitor accordingly. (See Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Suppression and also Systemic Effects, under Cautions.) Adverse local reactions may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings, especially with prolonged therapy. (See Local Effects under Cautions.) Do not use occlusive dressings on weeping or exudative lesions. Do not use occlusive dressings in patients with primary skin infection. Remove occlusive dressings covering large areas if body temperature increases; thermal homeostasis may be impaired. Use plastic occlusive material with care to avoid the risk of suffocation. When used in fixed combination with other agents, consider the cautions, precautions, and contraindications associated with the concomitant agents. Category C. Not known whether topical hydrocortisone is distributed into milk. Caution advised if topical hydrocortisone is used. Nonprescription hydrocortisone preparations should not be used in children <2 years of age unless directed and supervised by a clinician. Tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants should not be used on a child being treated in the diaper area, since such garments may constitute occlusive dressings. Children are more susceptible to topical corticosteroid-induced HPA-axis suppression and Cushingâs syndrome than mature individuals because of a greater skin surface area-to-body weight ratio, especially when topical corticosteroids are applied to >20% of body surface area. The risk of adrenal suppression appears to increase with decreasing age. (See Systemic Effects under Cautions.) Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol concentrations, and lack of response to corticotropin (ACTH) stimulation. Children also are at greater risk of glucocorticoid insufficiency during and/or after withdrawal of treatment. Intracranial hypertension has occurred in children; manifestations include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Striae has been reported in children treated inappropriately with topical corticosteroids. Topical corticosteroid therapy in children should be limited to the minimum amount necessary for therapeutic efficacy; chronic topical corticosteroid therapy may interfere with growth and development.

418,Ibandronate,"Prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Risk factors for postmenopausal osteoporosis and related fractures include early menopause, advanced age, low bone mineral density (BMD), low body mass index (BMI), previous fracture or family history of fracture/osteoporosis, excessive alcohol intake, smoking, inadequate physical activity, low calcium and vitamin D intake, certain drugs (e.g., glucocorticoids), and medical conditions or diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, Cushing syndrome, hyperparathyroidism). Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. In addition to adequate intake of calcium/vitamin D and other lifestyle modifications (e.g., exercise, avoidance of excessive alcohol and tobacco use), experts recommend that pharmacologic therapy for osteoporosis be considered in postmenopausal women with previous hip or vertebral fractures or low BMD; pharmacologic therapy also may be considered in postmenopausal women with low bone mass, although there is less evidence supporting overall fracture risk reduction in such patients. Use of a drug with proven efficacy in reducing fracture risk is recommended; bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid, ibandronate) are recommended as one of several first-line drugs. Individualize choice of therapy based on potential benefits (with respect to fracture risk reduction) and adverse effects of therapy, patient preferences, comorbidities, and risk factors. Also has been used in the management of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis â  [off-label] . American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommends optimizing calcium and vitamin D intake and lifestyle modifications (e.g., diet, smoking cessation, weight-bearing or resistance-training exercise) in all patients receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy; in addition, pharmacologic therapy with an oral bisphosphonate is recommended in patients who are considered to be at moderate-to-high risk of fracture. Oral bisphosphonates generally are preferred because of their demonstrated antifracture benefits, safety, and low cost.","Oral: Esophageal abnormalities that delay esophageal emptying (e.g., stricture, achalasia). Oral and IV: Uncorrected hypocalcemia. Oral and IV: Known hypersensitivity to ibandronate or any ingredient in the formulation. Oral: Inability to stand or sit upright for â¥60 minutes. Possible severe adverse esophageal effects (e.g., esophagitis, esophageal ulcers, erosions, strictures, perforation). (See Oral Administration under Dosage and Administration.) Monitor for any manifestations and discontinue if dysphagia, odynophagia, new or worsening heartburn, or retrosternal pain occurs. Use with caution in patients with active upper GI disease (e.g., Barrettâs esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, ulcers). Gastric and duodenal ulcers (some severe and with complications) reported during postmarketing experience. Injection must be administered IV by a health-care professional; do not administer by non-IV (e.g., intra-arterial) routes. (See Administration Risks under Dosage and Administration.) Correct hypocalcemia, hypovitaminosis D, and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism before initiating therapy. If daily intake inadequate, administer supplemental calcium and vitamin D. Osteonecrosis and osteomyelitis of the jaw reported in patients receiving bisphosphonates. Most cases associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing. Known risk factors include cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor oral hygiene, and comorbid disorders (e.g., periodontal and/or other preexisting dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures). Risk also may be increased with increased duration of bisphosphonate use. If osteonecrosis of the jaw develops, consult an oral surgeon for treatment. Dental surgery may exacerbate condition. In patients requiring dental procedures, discontinuance of therapy prior to procedure may reduce the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw. Base management of patients requiring dental treatment on an individual assessment of risks and benefits. Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain reported infrequently with bisphosphonate therapy. Time to onset varied from 1 day to years (mean onset about 3 months) after treatment initiation. If severe symptoms occur, consider discontinuing drug. Such pain generally improves following discontinuance, but may recur upon subsequent rechallenge with the same drug or another bisphosphonate. Atypical (subtrochanteric or diaphyseal) femur fractures reported rarely with long-term use (>3 years) of bisphosphonates, mostly in patients receiving these drugs for osteoporosis. Often occurs with minimal or no trauma, and may be bilateral. Causality not established; atypical fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients not receiving bisphosphonates. Risk may be increased with concomitant use of glucocorticoid, estrogen, and proton-pump inhibitor therapy. Evaluate patients who present with new thigh or groin pain for possibility of an atypical femoral fracture; include assessment of the contralateral limb. Consider interruption of bisphosphonate therapy in patients with manifestations of possible femoral fracture; weigh risks versus benefits of continued treatment. Discontinue if a femoral shaft fracture is confirmed. Although data are conflicting, possible increased risk of atrial fibrillation with use of bisphosphonates. FDA analysis of data from long-term (6 months to 3 years) controlled trials identified a higher rate of atrial fibrillation in patients receiving bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate, or zoledronic acid) versus placebo; however, only a few events reported in each study. FDA is continuing to monitor this safety concern. Some evidence (from postmarketing experience and observational studies) suggests a possible association between use of oral bisphosphonates and an increased risk of esophageal cancer. However, because of conflicting data, additional study needed to confirm such findings. FDA states that benefits of oral bisphosphonates continue to outweigh their potential risks in patients with osteoporosis; it is important to consider that esophageal cancer is rare, especially in women. Avoidance of oral bisphosphonates in patients with Barrettâs esophagus, a known precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma, has been recommended. Possible renal toxicity (e.g., deterioration of renal function and, rarely, renal failure) with bisphosphonates. Risk may be greater in patients with coexisting conditions associated with renal impairment, concomitant therapy with other nephrotoxic drugs, preexisting renal disease, dehydration, dosage, infusion volume and rate, and multiple cycles of treatment. Assess renal function in such patients. Use not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr <30 mL/minute). Measure S cr prior to each IV dose. Withhold treatment if deterioration of renal function occurs. Hypersensitivity reactions, including fatal anaphylaxis in patients who received ibandronate injection, reported. (See Contraindications under Cautions and see IV Administration under Dosage and Administration.) No data in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks. In reproductive animal studies, maternal and fetal toxicity (including postimplantation loss, developmental anomalies, and deaths) observed. Distributed into milk in rats; not known whether distributed into human milk. Also not known whether the drug has any effects on the nursing infant or milk production. Safety and efficacy not established in children. Not indicated for use in children. No substantial differences in safety and efficacy relative to younger adults, but increased sensitivity cannot be ruled out. Consider age-related decreases in renal function. Use not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (CL cr <30 mL/minute). Oral: Back pain, dyspepsia, pain in the extremities, diarrhea, headache, myalgia.

427,Imbruvica,"Imbruvica (ibrutinib) is used to treat WaldenstrÃ¶mâs macroglobulinemia (WM), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) in certain patients. Imbruvica is used to help slow cancer or disease progression in WM, CLL, SLL and cGVHD.Â  Imbruvica is taken once a day as a capsule, tablet or oral suspension. Imbruvica works by blocking an enzyme called Brutonâs tyrosine kinase (BTK) which lowers the survival of cancerous B cells and slows the spread of CLL or SLL. In WM Imbruvica helps abnormal B cells move out of the nourishing environments in the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other organs, and Imbruvica also inhibits specific immune cells that are involved in cGVHD. Imbruvica's mechanism of action is by directly inhibiting an enzyme, called Brutonâs tyrosine kinase (BTK). It forms a covalent bond with a cysteine residue on the enzyme, preventing its activity. BTK works as a signaling molecule for the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. Activation of these pathways causes the proliferation of B cells and other interactions, and inhibition has been shown to reduce the growth and spread of malignant B cells. It belongs to the class of medicines known as BTK inhibitors . Imbruvica was first FDA-approved on November 13, 2013.","Serious hemorrhage , including intracranial or gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hematuria, and post-procedural hemorrhage has occurred in people receiving Imbruvica, 0.4% have been fatal. 39% of people reported bleeding of any grade, including purpura and petechiae.

It contains clobetasol propionate 0.025% and should not be used for longer than 2 weeks. Impoyz cream is specially formulated using an ingredient called Transcutol that enhances the solubility of clobetasol and its permeation into plaques. This means that Impoyz is just as effective as other clobetasol creams but with half the usual concentration of clobetasol, which decreases its risk of side effects including absorption into the bloodstream. Transcutol is also less disrupting to the skinâs lamellar structure (a layer of lipids and water in the stratum corneum) than propylene glycol, which is traditionally used in creams to enhance drug solubility. Impoyz was FDA approved on December 1, 2017.","Impoyz cream contains clobetasol propionate which can be absorbed through the skin into the bloodstream and cause reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency, including Cushingâs syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. Do not use for longer than 2 weeks and do not exceed the recommended dose. Periodic monitoring for HPA suppression may be required. Occlusive dressings should not be used unless under the advice of the doctor because these increase the risk of side effects.","You should not use Impoyz if you are allergic to it.

442,Inflectra,"Inflectra (infliximab-dyyb) is a monocloncal antibody used to treat a range of inflammatory autoimmune diseases. Inflectra is a biological drug and one of four biosimilars of Remicade (infliximab). Biosimilar of Remicade are highly similar to it and are designed to have the same effect, but they are not identical. Inflectra works in the same way as the other versions of infliximab, by blocking the damage that results from too much tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Inflectra binds to TNF-alpha, which stops it from interacting with its receptors and certain activating processes. TNF-alpha is a protein and inflammatory cytokine which plays a key role in your normal immune response. It is involved in your inflammatory response and also helps to fight off infection and cancer. Some people, however, produce too much TNF-alpha and this can cause an autoimmune disease to develop. Inflectra was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016, 18 years after the original version of infliximab was introduced. It was the first biosimilar of Remicade to be approved.","Inflectra may cause serious side effects, including: 1. Risk of infection Inflectra is a medicine that affects your immune system. Inflectra can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Serious infections have happened in patients receiving Inflectra. These infections include tuberculosis (TB) and infections caused by viruses, fungi or bacteria that have spread throughout the body. Some patients have died from these infections. Before starting Inflectra, tell your doctor if you: After starting Inflectra, if you have an infection, any sign of an infection including a fever, cough, flu-like symptoms, or have open cuts or sores on your body, call your doctor right away. Inflectra can make you more likely to get infections or make any infection that you have worse. 2. Risk of Cancer See the section âWhat are the possible side effects of Inflectra?â below for more information.",You should not receive Inflectra if you have:,"Serious side effects of Inflectra include: The most common side effects of infliximab products include: Infusion reactions can happen up to 2 hours after your infusion of Inflectra. Symptoms of infusion reactions may include: Children with Crohnâs disease showed some differences in side effects of treatment compared with adults with Crohn's disease. The side effects that happened more in children were: anemia (low red blood cells), leukopenia (low white blood cells), flushing (redness or blushing), viral infections, neutropenia (low neutrophils, the white blood cells that fight infection), bone fracture, bacterial infection and allergic reactions of the breathing tract. Among patients who took infliximab for ulcerative colitis in clinical studies, more children had infections as compared with adults.

443,Infliximab,"Infliximab (brand names Avsola, Inflectra, Remicade, and others) reduces inflammation and may be used to treat autoimmune conditions such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, severe plaque psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Infliximab infusion is a monoclonal antibody that targets TNF-alpha . The mechanism of action of infliximab is to bind to and neutralize tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a key inflammatory protein involved in autoimmune diseases. By inhibiting TNF-alpha, infliximab helps reduce inflammation and its associated symptoms. Infliximab first gained FDA approval on August 24, 1998 , under the brand Remicade . Since then, 4 biosimilars have been approved for Remicade, and one other product, Zymfentra , is similar to Remicade but can be injected under the skin, so isn't considered a biosimilar.

444,Ingrezza,"Ingrezza (valbenazine) is used to treat tardive dyskinesia and chorea associated with Huntington's disease (HD), which are both body movement disorders. Ingrezza works by decreasing the amount of dopamine, in the nerve endings in the brain, which helps control body movements. Ingrezza is from a class of medicines called VMAT2 inhibitors , as it inhibits the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in neurons. This medicine controls the symptoms of movement disorders but does not cure the conditions. Tardive dyskinesia is a nervous system disorder that causes repetitive, uncontrolled muscle movements, usually in the face (chewing, lip smacking, frowning, tongue movement, blinking, or eye movement). Tardive dyskinesia is often caused by long-term treatment with certain psychiatric medications. Chorea is a movement disorder that results in sudden involuntary movements. It can be caused by Huntington's disease (an inherited disease that causes the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain). Ingrezza became an FDA-approved medicine on April 11, 2017, for adults with tardive dyskinesia, and on August 18, 2023, and it became approved for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease. The chorea associated with Huntington's disease approval was based on positive results from theÂ  KINECT-HD Phase 3 study and the ongoing KINECT-HD2 that showed an improvement in chorea severity with a statistically significant greater improvement in Total Maximal Chorea (TMC) score when compared to placebo. Ingrezza is available as capsules and Sprinkle capsules. The Ingrezza Sprinkle capsule can be opened and its contents sprinkled on soft food. This makes it easier to take for people who have difficulty swallowing capsules or for patients who prefer not to take capsules.","This medicine can cause: Depression and suicidal ideation and behavior are observed in patients with Huntingtonâs disease. Hypersensitivity, including angioedema, may occur. Treatment should be discontinued if this occurs. Somnolence and sedation may impair the patientâs ability to drive or operate hazardous machinery. QT Prolongation: There may be an increase in QT interval. Usage should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome or arrhythmias associated with prolonged QT interval. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) may occur. Treatment should be discontinued if this syndrome is observed. Parkinsonism: Some patients have reported Parkinson-like symptoms, including severe cases, during the postmarketing period. The dose of this medicine should be reduced or discontinued if clinically significant Parkinson-like signs or symptoms develop.","You should not use this medicine if you are allergic to valbenazine or any ingredients contained in this medicine. To make sure this medicine is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: Ingrezza may cause fetal harm. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, become pregnant, or plan to become pregnant.

477,Jardiance,"Jardiance (empagliflozin) is an FDA-approved tablet used to help control blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes and is also used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems in adults with heart failure or cardiovascular disease with type 2 diabetes. Jardiance lowers blood glucose levels (HbA1c) by helping the kidney increase the amount of glucose passing into the urine. Jardiance should be used together with diet and exercise when prescribed for type 2 diabetes. Jardiance 10mg tablets are also used for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults that have risk of disease prgression. In CKD Jardiance is used to reduce the risk of sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death and hospitalization. Jardiance is from the class of medicines called SGLT-2 inhibitors (sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors).Â  Jardiance works for type 2 diabetes by blocking SGLT-2 proteins located in the renal tubules of the kidneys, which are responsible for reabsorbing glucose back into the bloodstream. The way Jardiance works to reduce the risk of cardiovascular or heart failure is thought to be related to changes in heart muscle metabolism from favoring the use of glucose to using a more balanced combination of fatty acids, ketone bodies (ketone), branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and glucose. Jardiance also improves the heart's diastolic stiffness and diastolic function. Type 2 diabetes is a long-term condition when your blood sugars (HbA1c) become too high because the body does not produce or use insulin normally.Â  Over time high blood sugar can cause serious health problems, including heart disease , vision loss , and kidney disease.

488,Jornay PM,"Jornay PM is a once-a-day capsule used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It contains a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant called methylphenidate hydrochloride. It's not known exactly how Jornay PM works in people with ADHD, but it is a stimulant that increases activity in the brain, especially in the areas that help regulate behavior and attention. It helps to boost the levels of dopamine and noradrenaline, which are chemical messengers (neurotransmitters), by preventing their re-uptake from the space between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. Low levels of these chemical messengers have been found in people with ADHD. Jornay PM is taken in the evening. Each capsule contains two layers. The outside layer is designed to delay the release of the drug so that it doesn't start to be released until about 12 hours after it is taken. The inside layer extends the amount of time the drug is released into your body for. The two-layer approach is designed to help ensure Jornay PM is working when you wake up and keeps working during the day. Medications containing methylphenidate, such as Jornay PM, are schedule II federally controlled substances because they can be a target for people who abuse prescription medicines or street drugs. Selling or giving away Jornay PM may harm others, and is against the law. Jornay PM was approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018, although methylphenidate in another formulation was first approved many years earlier in 1955.","Jornay PM can cause serious side effects, including:",Do not take Jornay PM if you or your child is:,"Jornay PM can cause serious side effects, including: The most common side effects of methylphenidate products in children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD include: The most common side effects of Jornay PM, in children age 6 to 12 with ADHD include: These are not all the possible side effects of this medication.

Everyone has osteoclasts that dissolve old and damaged bone and osteoblasts that form new bones and add growth to existing bone tissue. Jubbonti works by stopping the formation of osteoclasts before they can reach and damage the bone. It binds to RANKL, a protein on the membrane of osteoclasts essential for their formation, function, and survival. This inhibits osteoclast formation, decreasing bone resorption and increasing bone mass and strength in both cortical (hard bone) and trabecular (spongy bone). Jubbonti is a monoclonal antibody that targets and inhibits RANK ligand (RANKL). Jubbonti is an interchangeable biosimilar to Prolia (denosumab) and was FDA-approved on March 5, 2024. An interchangeable biosimilar is a biological product that can be substituted in the pharmacy for the reference biologic because there are no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency.","Jubbonti carries a boxed warning for life-threatening severe hypocalcemia (very low calcium levels); the risk is higher in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly those on dialysis. The risk increases even more in those with CKD who also have a condition known as mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). Your healthcare provider will evaluate you for hypocalcemia and CKD-MBD before starting treatment and monitor you throughout. Pre-existing low calcium levels should be corrected before starting treatment. If you receive Jubbonti, you should not receive Prolia, Xgeva, or Wyost.

Good oral hygiene practices should be maintained during treatment with Jubbonti. Atypical low energy or low trauma femoral fractures have been reported with Jubbonti. Contact your doctor immediately if you develop thigh or groin pain. Multiple vertebral fractures have been reported following Jubbonti discontinuation. Your healthcare provider should consider transitioning you to another antiresorptive agent. Serious infections including skin infections may occur, including those leading to hospitalization. Seek emergency help or tell your healthcare provider immediately if you develop any signs or symptoms of an infection, including cellulitis (symptoms include a red, swollen, and painful area of skin that is warm and tender to the touch. Some people may also develop fever and chills). Other severe side effects including severe skin rashes and eczema, bone over-suppression, or severe bone, joint, or muscle pain may occur. Tell your healthcare provider immediately.","Tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you: For females who can become pregnant, your healthcare provider should do a pregnancy test before you start treatment with Jubbonti.

498,Juvederm,"Juvederm is a family of injectable hyaluronic acid dermal fillers used to provide 9 months to one year of correction for moderate to severe facial wrinkles and folds , such as nasolabial folds (lines from the nose to the corners of the mouth). It is also used for lip augmentation. Juvederm products are a smooth consistency gel, compared to some hyaluronic gel products that have a granular consistency. Juvederm products are developed using the Hylacross technology to allow a smoother, malleable gel. Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring sugar found in the body. Hyaluronic acid works by holding in water at the injection site and acting as a cushioning agent. It adds temporary volume and a smoother appearance to skin. Most patients need more than one treatment to achieve optimal results. Juvederm XC products also contain the local anesthetic lidocaine for a more comfortable injection as this numbs the treatment area within seconds. The Juvederm Ultra XC products contain more highly cross-linked formulations for volumizing and correction of deeper folds and wrinkles. The Juvederm range of products are designed to meet specific needs depending on the area of the face being treated and increase in volume required.","Contraindications : Juvederm injectable gel should not be used in patients who have severe allergies marked by a history of anaphylaxis or a history or presence of multiple severe allergies. Juvederm should not be used in patients with a history of allergies to Gram-positive bacterial proteins. Juvederm Ultra XC and Juvederm Ultra Plus XC should not be used in patients with a history of allergies to lidocaine. Warnings : Juvederm injectable gel should not be injected into blood vessels as this can cause blood vessel blockage which may result in skin tissue dying, vision impairment (temporary or permanent), and even stroke. If there is an active inflammatory process or infection at specific injection sites, treatment should be deferred until the underlying process is controlled. Precautions : Juvederm should only be administered under the supervision of a licensed health care practitioner.",No before section found.,"Juvederm Side Effects : Most Juvederm side effects are mild in nature and short-lived, usually resolving in 7 days or less.

499,Juxtapid,"Juxtapid is used along with diet changes (restriction of cholesterol and fat intake) and other treatments to reduce the amount of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol'), total cholesterol, and other fatty substances in the blood in people that have homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH; an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Juxtapid should not be used to decrease cholesterol levels in people who do not have HoFH. Juxtapid belongs to a class of medications called cholesterol-lowering medications. Lomitapide works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body. Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats may help prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks. It is not known whether Juxtapid will lower your risk of heart problems. Juxtapid is available only from a certified pharmacy under a special program. You must be registered in the program and understand the risks and benefits of this medicine.","You should not use Juxtapid if you have severe liver disease or a history of abnormal liver function tests.

534,Kisunla,"Kisunla (donanemab) is a prescription medicine used for the mild dementia stage of Alzheimerâs disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimerâs disease. Kisunla is a plaque-targeting therapy that helps to slow down the decline in memory, thinking, and daily functioning. This slows the progression of Alzheimerâs disease so people can continue their daily activities and hobbies and live independently for a longer time. Kisunla is given as a once-monthly IV infusion. Alzheimer's disease symptoms are thought to be related to clumps of amyloid protein (amyloid plaques) that can occur in the brain. Kisunla is an amyloid plaque-targeting therapy that works by helping the body remove amyloid plaques in the brain, which slows the progression of Alzheimerâs disease. Kisunla FDA approval was received on July 2, 2024, as a treatment for adults with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD), which includes people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well as people with mild dementia stage of AD, with confirmed amyloid pathology. Kisunla is an Eli Lilly and Company product.","Kisunla can cause serious side effects, including: Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities or ARIA. ARIA is a common side effect that does not usually cause any symptoms, but sometimes serious symptoms can occur. ARIA can be fatal. It is most commonly seen in an MRI as temporary swelling in areas of the brain that usually resolves over time. Some people may also have small spots of bleeding in or on the surface of the brain, and infrequently, larger areas of bleeding in the brain can occur. Most people who develop ARIA do not have symptoms; however, some people may have symptoms such as headache, dizziness, nausea, difficulty walking, confusion, vision changes, and seizures. If you have any of the symptoms of ARIA listed above, you should call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away. You are more at risk of ARIA if you have a genetic risk factor (homozygous apolipoprotein E Îµ4 gene carriers). Your healthcare provider may test to see if you have this risk factor. If you take medicines to reduce blood clots from forming (antithrombotic medicines) while receiving Kisunla, you may be at a higher risk of developing bleeding in the brain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are done before and during your treatment to check you for ARIA. You should carry information that you are receiving Kisunla, which can cause ARIA, and that ARIA symptoms can look like stroke symptoms. There are registries that collect information on treatments for Alzheimerâs disease. Your healthcare provider can help you become enrolled in these registries. Consider the risk of ARIA and the benefit of Alzheimer's disease when deciding to treat with Kisunla.",You should not receive this medicine if you have had serious allergic reactions to donanemab-azbt or any of the ingredients in this infusion.

However, its safety and effectiveness for these conditions has not been clinically determined.",No warnings section found.,No before section found.,"Kratom side effects include sedation, nausea, sweating, dry mouth, increased urination, loss of appetite, itching, constipation, dizziness, and confusion. Case reports also describe the following kratom side effects: addiction, withdrawal, hypothyroidism, liver injury, aching of muscles and bones, and jerky limb movements. Kratom addiction and chronic use have led to cases of psychosis with hallucinations, delusion, and confusion. High-dose use may lead to fast heart rate (tachycardia) and low blood pressure (hypotension). Tremor, anorexia, and weight loss are other possible side effects of long-term use. Seizures have been reported when kratom was combined with modafinil in at least one case report. The DEA has also reported seizure adverse events with recreational kratom use. A case series (Kronstad and colleagues) described a fatal drug interaction with kratom. A substance dubbed âKryptonâ - a mixture of mitragynine and a metabolite of tramadol - was found post-mortem in nine people in Sweden over a one-year period. Tramadol , an opioid-like prescription pain drug, was most likely added to kratom to boost its narcotic-like effect."
538,Krill Oil,"Krill is a small crustacean with an appearance similar to shrimp. They are found in the colder waters of the ocean. Krill primarily serve as a food source for other animals in the ocean, for example - whales, seals, penguins, squid and fish. Krill is found in the oceans off of Antarctica, Canada, and Japan. Harvesting of krill is controversial. There is concern that commercial harvesting of Krill for use in Krill Oil supplements could threaten the species that consume it for food, including whales. All krill oil sold in nutritional supplements is harvested out of the open ocean, upsetting the natural balance of food supplies for larger marine animals. Commercial uses of Krill include salmon aquaculture farming, harvesting for use in Krill Oil capsules, as food for home aquariums, and as a human food source. Krill, known as Okiami has been harvested by the Japanese as a human food source since the 19th century, and is also consumed in South Korea and Taiwan. Krill has a pink or red appearance due to the plankton that they consume as a food source in the ocean. 1","Take Krill Oil exactly as directed on the label, or as prescribed by your doctor. Do not take it in larger amounts or for longer than recommended. Krill Oil should not be used in patients with a fish or shrimp allergy, or probably any other type of seafood.

541,Kyleena,"Kyleena contains levonorgestrel , a female hormone that can cause changes in your cervical mucus and uterine lining, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and harder for a fertilized egg to attach to the uterus. The Kyleena levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system is a small, flexible plastic T-shaped device containing 19.5 mg levonorgestrel. The Kyleena intrauterine device (IUD) is placed in the uterus where it slowly releases the hormone. Because the IUD releases levonorgestrel into your uterus, only small amounts of the hormone enter your blood. Kyleena does not contain estrogen and should not be used as emergency birth control. The Kyleena IUD is placed in your uterus by your healthcare provider to prevent pregnancy for up to 5 years. The IUD can be removed by your healthcare provider at any time. Kleena can be used whether or not you have given birth to a child. Two thin threads are attached to the stem (lower end) of Kyleena. The threads are the only part of Kyleena you can feel when the IUD is in your uterus; however, unlike a tampon string, the threads do not extend outside your body.","You should not use the Kyleena IUD if you have abnormal vaginal bleeding, a pelvic infection, certain other problems with your uterus or cervix, or if you have breast or uterine cancer , liver disease or liver tumor, or a weak immune system. Do not use Kyleena during pregnancy. Call your doctor if you think you might be pregnant. Kyleena does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

The hormone in Kyleena may also cause unwanted effects in a female newborn. Tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant. If you continue the pregnancy, watch for signs such as fever, chills, cramps, vaginal bleeding or discharge. You should not use Kyleena if you are allergic to levonorgestrel, silicone, silica, silver, barium, iron oxide, or polyethylene, or if you have: abnormal vaginal bleeding that has not been checked by a doctor; an untreated or uncontrolled pelvic infection (vaginal, cervical, uterine); endometriosis or a serious pelvic infection following a pregnancy or abortion in the past 3 months; pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), unless you had a normal pregnancy after the infection was treated and cleared; uterine fibroid tumors or conditions that affect the shape of the uterus; past or present cancer of the breast, cervix, or uterus; liver disease or liver tumor (benign or malignant); a condition that weakens your immune system, such as AIDS, leukemia , or IV drug abuse; if you have another intrauterine device (IUD) in place; if you had an abortion or miscarriage in the past 6 weeks; or if you gave birth to a baby in the past 6 weeks. Tell your doctor if you have ever had: high blood pressure , heart problems, a heart attack , or a stroke; bleeding problems; migraine headaches; or a vaginal infection, pelvic infection, or sexually transmitted disease. You may use Kyleena when you are breastfeeding. Levonorgestrel is not likely to affect the quality or amount of your breast milk or the health of your nursing baby.

550,Lanadelumab,"Lanadelumab ( Takhzyro ) is used to prevent hereditary angioedema (HAE), lanadelumab helps to reduce the number and severity of hereditary angioedema attacks. Lanadelumab works by lowering the activity of a protein called kallikrein which helps to prevent the swelling and related symptoms of HAE. Lanadelumab is usually given every two weeks as an injection under the skin using a ready-to-use, prefilled syringe. The dose depends on age and can change to every 4 weeks if symptoms have improved. Hereditary angioedema is a rare condition that causes rapid attacks of swelling in areas under the skin around the face, arms, legs, and also the throat, which can be life-threatening if it blocks off the airways. People with hereditary angioedema have high levels of a protein called bradykinin, which makes fluid leak fluid into the surrounding tissue, causing swelling attacks.Â  Lanadelumab-flyo works by blocking another protein in the blood called 'kallikrein', which in turn reduces the level of bradykinin, which helps to prevent the swelling and symptoms of angioedema. Lanadelumab approval by the FDA was originally on February 3, 2023, and it is now approved to prevent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adult and pediatric patients 2 years and older. FDA approval was supported by data from HELP Study, theÂ  HELP OLE Study and the Phase 3 SPRING Study (NCT SHP643-301).

569,Levothyroxine,"Levothyroxine is used in adults and children to treat hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid - a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone). Levothyroxine is also used in adults along with surgery and radioactive iodine therapy to treat a certain type of thyroid cancer . Levothyroxine injection is used in adults to treat myxedema coma . Levothyroxine belongs to a class of medications called hormones. It works by replacing thyroid hormone that is normally produced by the body. Without thyroid hormone, your body cannot function properly, which may result in poor growth, slow speech, lack of energy, excessive tiredness, constipation, weight gain, hair loss, dry, thick skin, increased sensitivity to cold, joint and muscle pain, heavy or irregular menstrual periods, and depression. When taken correctly, levothyroxine reverses these symptoms.","You may not be able to use levothyroxine if you have certain medical conditions. Tell your doctor if you have an untreated or uncontrolled adrenal gland disorder or any heart problems such as a recent heart attack . Levothyroxine should not be used to treat obesity or weight problems. Dangerous side effects or death can occur from the misuse of this medicine, especially if you are taking any other weight-loss medications or appetite suppressants. Taking more than your recommended dose will not make this medicine more effective, and may cause serious side effects.","You should not use levothyroxine if you are allergic to glycerin or edetate disodium, or if you have an untreated or uncontrolled adrenal gland disorder. To make sure this medicine is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: a thyroid nodule; thyroiditis (inflammation of thyroid gland); heart problems such as a heart attack, stroke ; a blood clot or a blood clotting disorder; diabetes (your diabetes medicine may need to be adjusted); anemia (low red blood cells); weak bones ( osteoporosis ), or low bone mineral density; problems with your pituitary or adrenal gland; an allergy to any food or drugs; recently received radiation therapy with iodine (such as I-131); or kidney disease. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Having hypothyroidism during pregnancy may increase the risk of premature birth or other complications. The benefit of treating hypothyroidism may outweigh any risks to the baby. Your dose needs may be different during pregnancy. Tell your doctor if you are breastfeeding. Your dose needs may be different while you are nursing. You may be more likely to have a broken bone while using levothyroxine. Talk with your doctor about ways to keep your bones healthy.","Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to levothyroxine : hives, difficult breathing, swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. Levothyroxine may cause serious side effects. Call your doctor at once if you have: sudden pain or trouble moving your hip, wrist, or back; fast or irregular heartbeats; chest pain, pain spreading to your jaw or shoulder; wheezing ; fever , swollen glands, itching , joint pain , or not feeling well; nausea , vomiting , or diarrhea ; or high blood sugar - increased thirst, increased urination, dry mouth , fruity breath odor. Common levothyroxine side effects may include: fever, hot flashes , increased sweating ; tiredness; skin rash , hair loss ; chest pain, fast or irregular heartbeats, shortness of breath ; headache , leg cramps, muscle pain or weakness; tremors, feeling nervous or irritable, sleep problems ( insomnia ); increased or change in appetite; weight loss or weight gain; changes in your menstrual periods; or vomiting, diarrhea.

570,Lexapro,"Lexapro (escitalopram) is an antidepressant from the group of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and is used to treat certain types of depression and anxiety. It is not known how Lexapro works, but it is thought to block the reuptake of serotonin by nerves. This results in an increase in serotonin concentrations in the nerve synapse (the space between two nerves). Lexapro was FDA-approved on August 14, 2002.","You should not use Lexapro if you also take pimozide or citalopram ( Celexa ). Do not use Lexapro within 14 days before or 14 days after you have used an MAO inhibitor, such as isocarboxazid , linezolid , methylene blue injection, phenelzine , rasagiline , selegiline , or tranylcypromine . Young adults are at higher risk of having thoughts about suicide when first taking an antidepressant. Stay alert to changes in your mood or symptoms. Parents or caregivers should report any new or worsening mood symptoms in their child to their doctor. Also, be alert for signs of mania (excessively happy or active behavior). Seek medical attention right away if you have symptoms of serotonin syndrome, such as: agitation , hallucinations, fever, sweating, shivering, fast heart rate , muscle stiffness, twitching, loss of coordination, nausea , vomiting , or diarrhea . SSRIs, including Lexapro, may cause sexual problems. Symptoms in males may include delayed ejaculation or inability to have an ejaculation, decreased sex drive, and problems getting or keeping an erection. Symptoms in females may include decreased sex drive, delayed orgasm, or inability to have an orgasm. Talk to your healthcare provider if you develop any changes in your sexual function or if you have any questions or concerns about sexual problems during treatment with Lexapro. There may be treatments your healthcare provider can suggest. Do not give Lexapro to anyone under 12 years old.

Do not use Lexapro within 14 days before or 14 days after you have used an MAO inhibitor. A dangerous drug interaction could occur. MAO inhibitors include isocarboxazid, linezolid, phenelzine, rasagiline, selegiline, and tranylcypromine. Be sure your doctor knows if you also take stimulant medicine, opioid medicine, herbal products , or medicine for depression , mental illness, Parkinson's disease , migraine headaches, serious infections, or prevention of nausea and vomiting . These medicines may interact with escitalopram and cause a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. To make sure Lexapro is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: liver or kidney disease; seizures ; low levels of sodium in your blood; heart disease, high blood pressure ; a stroke; bleeding problems; sexual problems; bipolar disorder (manic depression); or drug addiction or suicidal thoughts. Tell your healthcare provider if you are pregnant, intending to become pregnant, or breastfeeding. Some young people have thoughts about suicide when first taking an antidepressant. Your doctor should check your progress at regular visits. Your family or other caregivers should also be alert to changes in your mood or symptoms. Lexapro is not approved for use by anyone younger than 12 years old. Ask your doctor about taking this medicine if you are pregnant. Taking an SSRI antidepressant during late pregnancy may cause serious medical complications in the baby. However, you may have a relapse of depression if you stop taking your antidepressant. Tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant. Do not start or stop taking Lexapro without your doctor's advice.

575,Liletta,"Liletta (levonorgestrel) is an intrauterine device (IUD) used to prevent pregnancy and also to treat heavy periods (menstrual bleeding).Â  Liletta is an IUD which is a small, flexible, T-shaped plastic device that is placed in the uterus, where it slowly releases the hormone levonorgestrel. The Liletta IUD works to prevent pregnancy by thickening the mucus at the entrance to the uterus to prevent sperm from entering, thinning the lining of the uterus, and preventing sperm from moving and surviving in the uterus. Liletta works to treat heavy periods by levonorgestrel effect on the uterus. Liletta works to treat heavy periods by controlling the monthly development of the uterus lining so there is less bleeding each month. Liletta contains levonorgestrel which is a progestin hormone; it does not contain estrogen. It should not be used as emergency birth control and does not protect you from sexually transmitted infections or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).",Do not use Liletta during pregnancy. Tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant.,"An IUD can increase your risk of developing a serious pelvic infection , which may threaten your life or your future ability to have children. Ask your doctor about this risk. You should not use Liletta if you are allergic to levonorgestrel, or other materials in this device. For a full list of ingredients, click here Liletta ingredients . You should not use Liletta if you have: abnormal vaginal bleeding that has not been checked by a doctor; an untreated or uncontrolled pelvic infection (vaginal, cervical, uterine); endometriosis or a serious pelvic infection following a pregnancy or abortion in the past 3 months; pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), unless you had a normal pregnancy after the infection was treated and cleared; uterine fibroid tumors or conditions that affect the shape of the uterus; past or present cancer of the breast, cervix, or uterus; liver disease or liver tumor (benign or malignant); a condition that weakens your immune system, such as AIDS, leukemia , or IV drug abuse; if you have another intrauterine device (IUD) in place; if you had an abortion or miscarriage in the past 6 weeks; or if you gave birth to a baby in the past 6 weeks. Tell your doctor if you have ever had: high blood pressure , heart problems, a heart attack , or a stroke; bleeding problems; migraine headaches; or a vaginal infection, pelvic infection, or sexually transmitted disease. Do not use during pregnancy. If left in place during pregnancy, Liletta could cause severe infection, miscarriage, premature birth, or death of the mother. The hormone Liletta may also cause unwanted effects in a female newborn. Tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant. If you continue the pregnancy, watch for signs such as fever, chills, cramps, vaginal bleeding, or discharge. Tell your doctor if you are breastfeeding. You may use Liletta when breastfeeding as it is not likely to affect the quality or amount of breast milk; however, a small number of patients who have taken progestin-only birth control pills report a decrease in the amount of milk produced. There is also an increased risk of Liletta becoming attached or going through the wall of the uterus when breastfeeding.","Common Liletta side effects may include: pelvic pain, painful or irregular menstrual periods, changes in bleeding patterns or flow; vaginal swelling, itching or infection; temporary pain, bleeding, or dizziness during insertion of the IUD; ovarian cysts (pelvic pain that disappears within 3 months); stomach pain, nausea , vomiting , bloating; headache , migraine, depression , mood changes; back pain , breast tenderness or pain; weight gain, acne, oily skin, changes in hair growth, loss of interest in sex; or puffiness in your face, hands, ankles, or feet. Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction : hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. Get emergency medical help if you have severe pain in your lower stomach or side. This could be a sign of a tubal pregnancy. The IUD may become embedded into the wall of the uterus, or may perforate (form a hole) in the uterus. If this occurs, the device may no longer prevent pregnancy, or it may move outside the uterus and cause scarring, infection, or damage to other organs. Your doctor may need to surgically remove the device. Serious Liletta side effects may include: Call your doctor at once if you have: severe cramps or pelvic pain, pain during sexual intercourse; extreme dizziness or light-headed feeling; severe migraine headache ; heavy or ongoing vaginal bleeding, vaginal sores, vaginal discharge that is watery, foul-smelling discharge, or otherwise unusual; pale skin, weakness, easy bruising or bleeding, fever, chills, or other signs of infection; jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes); or sudden numbness or weakness (especially on one side of the body), confusion, problems with vision, sensitivity to light.

Treatment of infections caused by susceptible vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium , including infections associated with concurrent bacteremia. Has been used for treatment of native valve or prosthetic valve infective endocarditis â  [off-label] caused by vancomycin-resistant or multidrug-resistant E. faecium . AHA recommends that patients with infective endocarditis attributable to enterococci resistant to penicillins, aminoglycosides, and vancomycin be managed by a team of specialists in infectious disease, cardiology, cardiovascular surgery, clinical pharmacy, and, if necessary, pediatrics. For information on diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis and its complications, including anti-infective treatment of enterococcal endocarditis, consult current AHA guidelines available at [Web] . Used in multiple-drug regimens for treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis â  [off-label] caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (i.e., caused by M. tuberculosis resistant to isoniazid and rifampin). ATS, CDC, and IDSA state that linezolid is one of various options that can be considered for inclusion in multiple-drug regimens used for treatment of MDR tuberculosis. WHO recommends that linezolid be included in multiple-drug regimens used for longer-term treatment (â¥18 months) of multidrug- or rifampin-resistant (MDR/RR) tuberculosis. Used in a 3-drug combination regimen that includes bedaquiline and pretomanid for treatment of extensively drug resistant (XDR) pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., caused by M. tuberculosis resistant to isoniazid, rifampin, any fluoroquinolone, and at least one injectable antituberculosis agent) or treatment-intolerant or non-responsive MDR pulmonary tuberculosis. WHO states that the 3-drug regimen of pretomanid, bedaquiline, and linezolid (also known as BPaL) may be used for treatment of MDR tuberculosis in patients who have not previously received either bedaquiline or linezolid (or received the drugs for â¤2 weeks) and have documented evidence that the MDR strain also is resistant to a fluoroquinolone. Patients with MDR or XDR tuberculosis are at high risk for treatment failure and acquisition of further drug resistance. ATS, CDC, and IDSA recommend that such patients be referred to or that consultation be obtained from a specialized treatment center as identified by local or state health departments or the CDC. For additional information on treatment of MDR and XDR tuberculosis, consult current guidelines from ATS/CDC/IDSA and WHO.","Known hypersensitivity to linezolid or any ingredient in the formulation. Current or recent (within the last 2 weeks) treatment with drugs that inhibit MAO A or B (e.g., isocarboxazid, phenelzine). (See Specific Drugs under Interactions.) Myelosuppression (anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia) reported. Toxicity studies in adult and juvenile dogs and rats indicate myelosuppression (bone marrow hypocellularity/decreased hematopoiesis; decreased extramedullary hematopoiesis in spleen and liver; decreased levels of circulating erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets) and lymphoid depletion in thymus, lymph nodes, and spleen. Monitor CBCs weekly during linezolid treatment, especially in those receiving the drug for >2 weeks and in those who have preexisting myelosuppression, are receiving concomitant drugs associated with bone marrow suppression, or have a chronic infection that was or is being treated with concomitant anti-infective therapy. Consider discontinuing linezolid if myelosuppression develops or worsens. Hematologic parameters generally have increased toward pretreatment values following discontinuance of the drug. Peripheral and optic neuropathies reported in adults and children receiving linezolid, principally in those receiving the drug for >28 days. Optic neuropathy progressing to loss of vision reported when linezolid used for >28 days. Blurred vision reported in some patients who received the drug for <28 days. If patient experiences symptoms of visual impairment (e.g., changes in visual acuity or color vision, blurred vision, visual field defect), promptly perform an ophthalmic evaluation. Monitor visual function in all patients receiving linezolid for extended periods of time (i.e., â¥3 months). In addition, monitor visual function in all patients reporting a new visual symptom, regardless of length of linezolid treatment. If peripheral or optic neuropathy occurs, weigh potential benefits versus risks of continued linezolid treatment. Serotonin syndrome (including some fatalities) reported in patients receiving linezolid concomitantly with serotonergic drugs. Signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome include mental changes (confusion, hyperactivity, memory problems), muscle twitching, excessive sweating, shivering, shaking, diarrhea, loss of coordination, and/or fever. Most reported cases occurred in patients receiving linezolid concomitantly with SSRIs or SNRIs. FDA has not concluded whether concomitant use of linezolid with other drugs with lesser degrees of serotonergic activity (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, MAO inhibitors) is associated with a risk comparable to that reported with SSRIs or SNRIs. Unless considered clinically appropriate and patients can be carefully monitored for signs and/or symptoms of serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome-like (NMS-like) reactions, do not use linezolid in patients with carcinoid syndrome or in patients receiving SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin 5-HT 1 receptor agonists (triptans), meperidine, bupropion, or buspirone. (See Specific Drugs under Interactions.) In cases when patient is already receiving a serotonergic antidepressant or buspirone and urgent treatment with linezolid is required (e.g., life-threatening infection caused by MRSA or vancomycin-resistant E. faecium ) and alternatives to linezolid are not available and potential benefits of the drug outweigh risks of serotonin syndrome or NMS-like reactions, stop the serotonergic antidepressant promptly and administer linezolid. Monitor for manifestations of serotonin syndrome or NMS-like reactions (e.g., hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability, mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma) for 2 weeks (5 weeks if fluoxetine was taken) or until 24 hours after last linezolid dose, whichever comes first. Also monitor for symptoms associated with discontinuance of the antidepressant. In an investigational study in seriously ill patients with intravascular catheter-related infections â  [off-label] , mortality was higher in patients receiving linezolid than in patients receiving a comparator anti-infective (vancomycin, oxacillin, dicloxacillin); patients also could receive concomitant therapy for gram-negative infection. There was no difference in mortality between linezolid and comparator regimens in patients with only gram-positive bacteria identified in the baseline culture; mortality was higher in linezolid-treated patients with gram-negative bacterial infections, mixed gram-positive and gram-negative infections, or no pathogen identified at baseline. Causality not established. Not approved by FDA for treatment of catheter-related bacteremia or catheter-site infections; not approved for treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections. Linezolid is a weak, nonselective, reversible inhibitor of MAO, and potentially may interact with MAO inhibitors and adrenergic and serotonergic agents. (See Specific Drugs under Interactions.) Significant pressor response reported when tyramine doses >100 mg were used in adults receiving linezolid. Instruct patients to avoid large quantities of foods or beverages with high tyramine content during linezolid treatment. Foods high in tyramine content include those that may have undergone protein changes by aging, fermentation, pickling, or smoking to improve flavor (e.g., aged cheeses, fermented or air-dried meat, sauerkraut, soy sauce, tap beer, red wine). Consider that tyramine content of any protein-rich food may be increased if stored for long periods or improperly refrigerated. Unless monitored for potential increases in BP, do not use linezolid in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, pheochromocytoma, or thyrotoxicosis or in patients receiving direct- or indirect-acting sympathomimetic agents (e.g., pseudoephedrine), vasopressor agents (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), or dopaminergic agents (e.g., dopamine, dobutamine). (See Specific Drugs under Interactions.) Lactic acidosis, characterized by recurrent nausea and vomiting, reported. Patients who develop recurrent nausea and vomiting, unexplained acidosis, or a low bicarbonate concentration while receiving linezolid should undergo immediate medical evaluation. Seizures reported; history of seizures or risk factors for seizures noted in some cases. Symptomatic hypoglycemia reported in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving linezolid concomitantly with insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Although causal relationship between linezolid and hypoglycemia not established, caution patients with diabetes mellitus about potential for hypoglycemia during linezolid treatment. If hypoglycemia occurs, dosage reduction of insulin or oral antidiabetic agents or discontinuance of linezolid, insulin, or oral antidiabetic agents may be necessary. Anaphylaxis, angioedema, and bullous skin disorders, including severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) such as toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, reported. Superficial tooth discoloration and tongue discoloration reported. In cases with known outcome, tooth discoloration was removable with professional dental cleaning (manual descaling). Oral suspension contains aspartame, which is metabolized in the GI tract to provide 20 mg of phenylalanine per 5 mL of suspension. Linezolid tablets do not contain aspartame and should be used in individuals with phenylketonuria (i.e., homozygous genetic deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase) and other individuals who must restrict their intake of phenylalanine. Possible emergence and overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Monitor carefully; institute appropriate therapy if superinfection occurs. Treatment with anti-infectives alters normal colon flora and may permit overgrowth of Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile ). C. difficile infection (CDI) and C. difficile -associated diarrhea and colitis (CDAD; also known as antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis or pseudomembranous colitis) reported with nearly all anti-infectives, including linezolid, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD; hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile are associated with increased morbidity and mortality since they may be refractory to anti-infectives and colectomy may be required. Consider CDAD if diarrhea develops during or after therapy and manage accordingly. Obtain careful medical history since CDAD may occur as late as â¥2 months or longer after anti-infective therapy is discontinued. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, discontinue anti-infectives not directed against C. difficile whenever possible. Initiate appropriate anti-infective therapy directed against C. difficile (e.g., fidaxomicin, vancomycin, metronidazole), supportive therapy (e.g., fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation), and surgical evaluation as clinically indicated. Linezolid is indicated only for treatment of certain infections caused by certain gram-positive bacteria. The drug has no clinical activity against gram-negative bacteria and is not indicated for treatment of infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. It is imperative that an anti-infective active against gram-negative bacteria be used concomitantly if documented or presumptive pathogens also include gram-negative bacteria. (See Uses.) Safety and efficacy of linezolid given for >28 days not evaluated in controlled clinical trials. (See Dosage under Dosage and Administration.) To reduce development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of linezolid and other antibacterials, use only for treatment of infections proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When selecting or modifying anti-infective therapy, use results of culture and in vitro susceptibility testing. In the absence of such data, consider local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns when selecting anti-infectives for empiric therapy. Information on test methods and quality control standards for in vitro susceptibility testing of antibacterials and specific interpretive criteria for such testing recognized by FDA is available at [Web] . For most antibacterials, including linezolid, FDA recognizes the standards published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Available data from published and postmarketing case reports regarding use of linezolid in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes In mice, rats, and rabbits, linezolid was not teratogenic; however, embryofetal toxicities reported (e.g, post-implantational embryo death, decreased fetal body weights, increased incidence of costal cartilage fusion, reduced ossification). Distributed into human milk; not known whether the drug affects the breast-fed infant or affects milk production. Consider benefits of breast-feeding and the importance of linezolid to the woman along with potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition. If used in a nursing woman, manufacturer recommends monitoring breast-fed infant for diarrhea and vomiting since these are the most common adverse reactions reported in infants being treated with linezolid. Based on findings from animal studies, linezolid may reversibly impair fertility in males. In adult male rats, reversible decrease in fertility and reproductive performance reported. The effects on fertility were mediated through altered spermatogenesis; affected spermatids contained abnormally formed and oriented mitochondria and were nonviable. Epithelial cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia in the epididymis observed in conjunction with decreased fertility. Safety and efficacy for treatment of CAP, nosocomial pneumonia, complicated skin and skin structure infections, and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium infections in pediatric patients are supported by adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, pharmacokinetic studies in pediatric patients, and additional data from a comparator-controlled study of gram-positive infections in neonates and children through 11 years of age. Safety and efficacy for treatment of CAP in pediatric patients also is supported by evidence from an uncontrolled study in patients 8 months through 12 years of age. Safety and efficacy for treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections in pediatric patients established in a comparator-controlled study in pediatric patients 5â17 years of age. In children with a suboptimal response to linezolid, especially those with infections caused by pathogens with linezolid MICs of 4 mcg/mL, consider inadequate systemic exposure, site and severity of infection, and underlying medical conditions. Manufacturer states not recommended for empiric treatment of CNS infections in pediatric patients. (See Distribution under Pharmacokinetics.) Pharmacokinetic, safety, and efficacy profiles similar to those in younger adults. Possibility of greater sensitivity in some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A or B): Pharmacokinetics not altered. Severe hepatic impairment: Pharmacokinetics not evaluated. Although clinical importance not determined, the 2 principal metabolites of linezolid may accumulate in patients with impaired renal function; amount of accumulation increases with severity of renal impairment. Weigh potential benefits against potential risks of accumulation of linezolid metabolites. (See Renal Impairment under Dosage and Administration.)

578,Liothyronine,Liothyronine is a man-made form of a hormone that is normally produced by your thyroid gland to regulate the body's energy and metabolism. Liothyronine is given when the thyroid does not produce enough of this hormone on its own. Liothyronine treats hypothyroidism ( low thyroid hormone). Liothyronine is also given as part of a medical test for thyroid disorders. Liothyronine is also used together with surgery and radioactive iodine therapy in people with thyroid cancer . Liothyronine should not be used to treat obesity or weight problems. Liothyronine may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.,"Liothyronine should not be used to treat obesity or weight problems.

579,Lipitor,"Lipitor is used together with diet, weight loss, and exercise to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke and to decrease the chance that heart surgery will be needed in people who have heart disease or who are at risk of developing heart disease. Lipitor is also used to lower the amount of fatty substances such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol') and triglycerides in the blood and to increase the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ('good cholesterol') in the blood. Lipitor may also be used to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood in children and teenagers 10 to 17 years of age who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Lipitor (atorvastatin) belongs to a class of medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). It works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body. Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats with Lipitor has been shown to prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks.","You should not take Lipitor if you have liver disease or cirrhosis . Lipitor can cause the breakdown of muscle tissue, which can lead to kidney failure . Call your doctor right away if you have unexplained muscle pain , tenderness, or weakness especially if you also have fever , unusual tiredness, or dark urine. Serious drug interactions can occur when certain medicines are used together with Lipitor. Tell each of your healthcare providers about all medicines you use now, and any medicine you start or stop using. Avoid eating foods that are high in fat or cholesterol. Lipitor will not be as effective in lowering your cholesterol if you do not follow a cholesterol-lowering diet plan. Lipitor is only part of a complete program of treatment that also includes diet, exercise, and weight control.

Lupron injection 14-day kit may be used to delay the release of eggs that will be retrieved for in vitro fertilization (IVF). Lupron Depot may also be used to treat other hormone-related conditions, off-label (off-label means not an FDA-approved use but a recognized use of the medicine). Lupron Depot-GYN and many other branded leuprolide products are no longer available commercially in the U.S., but generic options are available through several manufacturers. Initially, leuprolide works by stimulating gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors, which, at the beginning causes a surge in FSH and LH because GnRH controls the secretion of these hormones. However chronic administration causes a downregulation of these receptors, reducing the release of FSH and LH, and subsequent suppression of ovarian and testicular production of estradiol and testosterone respectively. It belongs to the class of medicines known as gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonists). Lupron was first FDA-approved in 1985.","Do not use Lupron Depot if you are allergic to leuprolide or similar medicines such as buserelin, goserelin, histrelin, or nafarelin, or if you have abnormal vaginal bleeding that has not been checked by a doctor. Your symptoms may become temporarily worse when you first start using Lupron Depot. In adults, this may cause transient worsening of symptoms, including the signs and symptoms of prostate cancer, bone pain, or endometriosis during the first few weeks of treatment. In children, there may be a temporary increase in the clinical signs and symptoms of puberty, including vaginal bleeding. Tell your doctor if any increase in symptoms continues for longer than 2 months. GnRH analogs may be associated with an increased risk of seizures in people with or without a history of predisposing factors, and in children, there is an increased risk of psychiatric events and mood changes, such as emotional lability (eg, crying, irritability, impatience, anger, and aggression). Call your doctor at once if you have a seizure or unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pseudotumor Cerebri (high pressure inside the skull) has been reported in children receiving GnRH agonists, including Lupron Depot-Ped. Monitor children for headaches, swelling of the optic nerve, and blurred vision. The risk of developing diabetes is increased in people receiving GnRH analogs. Your doctor will monitor your blood glucose level and manage any changes according to guidelines. GnRH analogs are associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, and stroke. Your doctor will monitor you for cardiovascular disease, and heart arrhythmias, and manage according to current clinical practice. Leuprolide can harm an unborn baby or cause birth defects. Do not use it if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.","Certain brands or strengths of leuprolide are used to treat only men and should not be used in women or children. Always check your medicine to make sure you have received the correct brand and strength. Ask the pharmacist if you have any questions about the medicine you receive at the pharmacy. To make sure Lupron Depot is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had: Call your doctor if your periods continue while you are being treated with this medicine. Do not give this medicine to any child without medical advice. Lupron Depot usually causes women to stop ovulating or having menstrual periods. However, you may still be able to get pregnant. Leuprolide can cause birth defects and should not be used if you are pregnant. Use a condom or diaphragm with spermicide to prevent pregnancy because leuprolide can make hormonal birth control less effective. Tell your doctor right away if you inadvertently become pregnant. You should not breastfeed while using leuprolide. Leuprolide may cause infertility, although research shows full reversibility of fertility suppression when leuprolide is discontinued after continuous administration for up to 24 weeks. Lupron may be used to delay egg release for IVF treatment.","Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to Lupron Depot (such as hives, sweating, fast heartbeats, dizziness, difficulty breathing, swelling in your face or throat) or a severe skin reaction (fever, sore throat, burning in your eyes, skin pain, a red or purple skin rash that spreads and causes blistering and peeling).

611,Melatonin,"Melatonin is the natural hormone your body secretes that helps to maintain your wake-sleep cycle (also called âbiological clockâ). Melatonin is also made synthetically and available without a prescription as an over-the-counter (OTC) dietary supplement in the U.S. Melatonin is most commonly used to: The wake-sleep cycle is the process of sleep and wakefulness; in humans this averages 8 hours of nighttime sleep and 16 hours of daytime activity. Supplemental Melatonin has been suggested to have many uses, from sleep disorders to cancer treatment, but adequate studies are lacking for many uses. It has been widely studied for treatment of jet lag and other sleep disorders. Endogenous melatonin release (made by our bodies) is increased each day in response to darkness, peaking between 11PM and 3AM at roughly 200 picograms (pg) per mL. Nighttime levels are roughly 10 times higher than in the daytime. Levels fall sharply before daylight, and are barely detectable in the daylight hours. The rise and fall in endogenous levels signal wake and sleep times, known as our circadian rhythm. Natural melatonin production starts from the amino acid tryptophan, with serotonin as an intermediary, and then is released to the receptors in the brain, eye and other areas to help control the sleep quality and wake cycles. The half-life is short, roughly 20 to 50 minutes. It is metabolized (broken down) by the CYP450 enzyme system in the liver and then excreted in the urine or feces. Shorter periods of production occur in the summer with longer days, and more prolonged periods of production occur in the winter. Light at night (such as from smartphones or the TV) blocks production and can lead to sleep disturbances. Age also suppresses the levels of nighttime melatonin that are released, which may contribute to the problem of insomnia and early awakening often seen in older adults.",No warnings section found.,"Do not use melatonin if you are allergic to it.

Treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (including polymicrobial infections such as abscess) caused by susceptible Bacteroides fragilis , B. thetaiotaomicron , Clostridium perfringens , Enterococcus faecalis , E. coli , Proteus mirabilis , S. anginosus , S. constellatus , or Peptostreptococcus . Has been recommended as one of several options for initial empiric treatment of mild to moderate, community-acquired intra-abdominal infections. IDSA states avoid moxifloxacin in patients who received a quinolone within the past 3 months and are likely to harbor B. fragilis since such strains likely to be resistant to the drug. Consult current IDSA clinical practice guidelines available at [Web] for additional information on management of intra-abdominal infections. Alternative for treatment of endocarditis â  [off-label] (native or prosthetic valve or other prosthetic material) caused by fastidious gram-negative bacilli known as the HACEK group ( Haemophilus , Aggregatibacter , Cardiobacterium hominis , Eikenella corrodens , Kingella ). AHA and IDSA recommend ceftriaxone (or other third or fourth generation cephalosporin), but state that a fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) may be considered in patients who cannot tolerate cephalosporins. Consultation with an infectious disease specialist recommended. Alternative for treatment of campylobacteriosis â  [off-label] caused by susceptible Campylobacter . Optimal treatment of campylobacteriosis in HIV-infected patients not identified. Some clinicians withhold anti-infective treatment in those with CD4 + T-cell counts >200 cells/mm 3 and mild campylobacteriosis and initiate treatment if symptoms persist for more than several days. In those with mild to moderate campylobacteriosis, treatment with a fluoroquinolone (preferably ciprofloxacin or, alternatively, levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) or azithromycin is reasonable. Modify anti-infective treatment based on results of in vitro susceptibility; resistance to fluoroquinolones reported in 22% of C. jejuni and 35% of C. coli isolates tested in the US. Treatment of Salmonella gastroenteritis â  [off-label] . CDC, NIH, and HIV Medicine Association of IDSA recommend ciprofloxacin as initial drug of choice for treatment of Salmonella gastroenteritis (with or without bacteremia) in HIV-infected adults; other fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) also likely to be effective, but data limited. Depending on in vitro susceptibility, alternatives are co-trimoxazole and third generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime). Role of long-term anti-infective treatment (secondary prophylaxis) against Salmonella in HIV-infected individuals with recurrent bacteremia or gastritis not well established; weigh benefits of such prophylaxis against risks of long-term anti-infective therapy. Treatment of shigellosis â  [off-label] caused by susceptible Shigella . Anti-infectives may not be required for mild infections, but generally indicated in addition to fluid and electrolyte replacement for treatment of patients with severe shigellosis, dysentery, or underlying immunosuppression. Empiric treatment regimen can be used initially, but in vitro susceptibility testing indicated since resistance is common. Fluoroquinolones (preferably ciprofloxacin or, alternatively, levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) have been recommended for treatment of shigellosis in HIV-infected adults, but consider that fluoroquinolone-resistant Shigella reported in the US, especially in international travelers, the homeless, and men who have sex with men (MSM). Depending on in vitro susceptibility, other drugs recommended for treatment of shigellosis include co-trimoxazole, ceftriaxone, azithromycin (not recommended in those with bacteremia), or ampicillin. Alternative for postexposure prophylaxis of anthrax â  following suspected or confirmed exposure to aerosolized Bacillus anthracis spores (inhalational anthrax). CDC, AAP, US Working Group on Civilian Biodefense, and US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) recommend oral ciprofloxacin and oral doxycycline as initial drugs of choice for prophylaxis following such exposures, including exposures that occur in the context of biologic warfare or bioterrorism. Other oral fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, ofloxacin) are alternatives when ciprofloxacin or doxycycline cannot be used. Treatment of uncomplicated cutaneous anthrax â  (without systemic involvement) that occurs in the context of biologic warfare or bioterrorism. CDC states that preferred drugs for such infections include ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, levofloxacin, or moxifloxacin. Alternative to ciprofloxacin for use in multiple-drug parenteral regimen for initial treatment of systemic anthrax â  (inhalational, GI, meningitis, or cutaneous with systemic involvement, head or neck lesions, or extensive edema) that occurs in the context of biologic warfare or bioterrorism. For initial treatment of systemic anthrax with possible or confirmed meningitis, CDC and AAP recommend a regimen of IV ciprofloxacin in conjunction with another IV bactericidal anti-infective (preferably meropenem) and an IV protein synthesis inhibitor (preferably linezolid). If meningitis excluded, these experts recommend an initial regimen of IV ciprofloxacin in conjunction with an IV protein synthesis inhibitor (preferably clindamycin or linezolid). Has been suggested as possible alternative to ciprofloxacin for treatment of inhalational anthrax â  when a parenteral regimen not available (e.g., supply or logistic problems because large numbers of individuals require treatment in a mass casualty setting). Alternative for treatment of meningitis â  caused by certain susceptible gram-positive bacteria (e.g., S. pneumoniae ). Fluoroquinolones have been recommended as alternatives for treatment of meningitis caused by some gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Neisseria meningitidis , H. influenzae , E. coli , Ps. aeruginosa ). Limited data from animal studies indicate moxifloxacin has been effective for treatment of experimental meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae or E. coli . Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin) should be considered for treatment of meningitis only when the infection is caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli or when the usually recommended anti-infectives cannot be used or have been ineffective. Alternative (second-line) agent for use in multiple-drug regimens for treatment of active tuberculosis â  caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Although potential role of fluoroquinolones and optimal length of therapy not fully defined, ATS, CDC, IDSA, and others state that use of fluoroquinolones as alternative (second-line) agents can be considered for treatment of active tuberculosis in patients intolerant to certain first-line agents and in those with relapse, treatment failure, or M. tuberculosis resistant to certain first-line agents. If a fluoroquinolone used in multiple-drug regimens for treatment of active tuberculosis, ATS, CDC, IDSA, and others recommend levofloxacin or moxifloxacin. Consider that fluoroquinolone-resistant M. tuberculosis reported and there are increasing reports of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR tuberculosis). XDR tuberculosis is caused by M. tuberculosis resistant to rifampin and isoniazid (multiple-drug resistant strains) that also are resistant to a fluoroquinolone and at least one parenteral second-line antimycobacterial (capreomycin, kanamycin, amikacin). Consult most recent ATS, CDC, and IDSA recommendations for treatment of tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections for more specific information. Has been used in multiple-drug regimens for treatment of disseminated infections caused by Mycobacterium avium complex â  (MAC). ATS and IDSA state that role of fluoroquinolones in treatment of MAC infections not established. If a fluoroquinolone is included in treatment regimen (e.g., for macrolide-resistant MAC infections), moxifloxacin or levofloxacin may be preferred, although many strains are resistant in vitro. Treatment of MAC infections is complicated and should be directed by clinicians familiar with mycobacterial diseases; consultation with a specialist is particularly important when the patient cannot tolerate first-line drugs or when the infection has not responded to prior therapy or is caused by macrolide-resistant MAC. Treatment of M. kansasii â  infections in conjunction with other antimycobacterials. ATS and IDSA recommend a multiple-drug regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol for treatment of pulmonary or disseminated infections caused by M. kansasii . If rifampin-resistant M. kansasii are involved, ATS and IDSA recommend a 3-drug regimen based on results of in vitro susceptibility testing, including clarithromycin (or azithromycin), moxifloxacin, ethambutol, sulfamethoxazole, or streptomycin. Consult most recent ATS, CDC, and IDSA recommendations for treatment of other mycobacterial infections for more specific information. Alternative for treatment of nongonococcal urethritis â  (NGU). CDC recommends azithromycin or doxycycline; alternatives are erythromycin, levofloxacin, or ofloxacin. For persistent or recurrent NGU in men compliant with previous treatment who have not been reexposed to an untreated sexual partner(s), CDC recommends that those initially treated with azithromycin be retreated with moxifloxacin. Treatment of plague, including pneumonic and septicemic plague, caused by Yersinia pestis . Streptomycin (or gentamicin) historically has been considered regimen of choice for treatment of plague; alternatives are doxycycline (or tetracycline), chloramphenicol (a drug of choice for plague meningitis), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin [a drug of choice for plague meningitis], levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), or co-trimoxazole (may be less effective than other alternatives). Regimens recommended for treatment of naturally occurring or endemic bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic plague also recommended for plague that occurs following exposure to Y. pestis in the context of biologic warfare or bioterrorism. Postexposure prophylaxis following high-risk exposure to Y. pestis (e.g., household, hospital, or other close contact with an individual who has pneumonic plague; laboratory exposure to viable Y. pestis ; confirmed exposure in the context of biologic warfare or bioterrorism). Drugs of choice for such prophylaxis are doxycycline (or tetracycline) or a fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, ofloxacin).","History of hypersensitivity to moxifloxacin or other quinolones. Systemic fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions (e.g., tendinitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, CNS effects) that can occur together in the same patient. May occur within hours to weeks after a systemic fluoroquinolone is initiated; have occurred in all age groups and in patients without preexisting risk factors for such adverse reactions. Immediately discontinue moxifloxacin at first signs or symptoms of any serious adverse reactions. Avoid systemic fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, in patients who have experienced any of the serious adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones. Systemic fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, are associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all age groups. Risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture increased in older adults (usually those >60 years of age), individuals receiving concomitant corticosteroids, and kidney, heart, or lung transplant recipients. (See Geriatric Use under Cautions.) Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones who did not have any risk factors for such adverse reactions. Fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture most frequently involve the Achilles tendon; also reported in the rotator cuff (shoulder), hand, biceps, thumb, and other tendon sites. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur within hours or days after moxifloxacin is initiated or as long as several months after completion of therapy and can occur bilaterally. Immediately discontinue moxifloxacin if pain, swelling, inflammation, or rupture of a tendon occurs. (See Advice to Patients.) Avoid systemic fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or have experienced tendinitis or tendon rupture. Systemic fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, are associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias, and weakness reported with fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin. Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of the drug and, in some patients, may be irreversible. Immediately discontinue moxifloxacin if symptoms of peripheral neuropathy (e.g., pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness) occur or if there are other alterations in sensations (e.g., light touch, pain, temperature, position sense, vibratory sensation). Avoid systemic fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, in patients who have experienced peripheral neuropathy. Systemic fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, are associated with increased risk of psychiatric adverse effects, including toxic psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, depression, suicidal thoughts or acts, agitation, nervousness, confusion, delirium, disorientation, disturbances in attention, insomnia, nightmares, and memory impairment. These adverse effects may occur after first dose. Systemic fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, are associated with increased risk of seizures (convulsions), increased intracranial pressure (including pseudotumor cerebri), dizziness, and tremors. These CNS effects may occur after first dose. Use with caution in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders (e.g., severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, epilepsy) or other risk factors that predispose to seizures or lower seizure threshold. If psychiatric or other CNS effects occur, immediately discontinue moxifloxacin and institute appropriate measures. (See Advice to Patients.) Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in myasthenia gravis patients; death or need for ventilatory support reported. Avoid use in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis. (See Advice to Patients.) Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity and/or anaphylactic reactions reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin. Although generally reported after multiple doses, these reactions may occur with first dose. Some hypersensitivity reactions have been accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, tingling, edema (pharyngeal or facial), dyspnea, urticaria, or pruritus. Other serious and sometimes fatal adverse reactions reported with fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, that may or may not be related to hypersensitivity reactions include one or more of the following: fever, rash or other severe dermatologic reactions (e.g., toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome); vasculitis, arthralgia, myalgia, serum sickness; allergic pneumonitis; interstitial nephritis, acute renal insufficiency or failure; hepatitis, jaundice, acute hepatic necrosis or failure; anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia (including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura), leukopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and/or other hematologic effects. Immediately discontinue moxifloxacin at first appearance of rash, jaundice, or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Institute appropriate therapy as indicated (e.g., epinephrine, corticosteroids, maintenance of an adequate airway and oxygen). Moderate to severe photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions reported with fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin. Phototoxicity may manifest as exaggerated sunburn reactions (e.g., burning, erythema, exudation, vesicles, blistering, edema) on areas exposed to sun or artificial ultraviolet (UV) light (usually the face, neck, extensor surfaces of forearms, dorsa of hands). Avoid unnecessary or excessive exposure to sunlight or artificial UV light (tanning beds, UVA/UVB treatment) while receiving moxifloxacin. If patient needs to be outdoors, they should wear loose-fitting clothing that protects skin from sun exposure and use other sun protection measures (sunscreen). Discontinue moxifloxacin if photosensitivity or phototoxicity (sunburn-like reaction, skin eruption) occurs. Prolonged QT interval leading to ventricular arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes, reported with some fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin. Do not exceed usual recommended dosage or IV infusion rate since this may increase risk of prolonged QT interval. Avoid use in patients with known prolonged QT interval, ventricular arrhythmias (including torsades de pointes), any ongoing proarrhythmic conditions (including clinically important bradycardia and acute myocardial ischemia), or uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. Avoid use in patients receiving class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents or other drugs that prolong QT interval (e.g., cisapride [available in the US only under a limited-access protocol], erythromycin, antipsychotic agents, tricyclic antidepressants). (See Drugs that Prolong QT Interval under Interactions.) Risk of QT interval prolongation may be increased in geriatric patients. (See Geriatric Use under Cautions.) Use with caution in patients with mild, moderate, or severe liver cirrhosis. (See Hepatic Impairment under Cautions.) Rupture or dissection of aortic aneurysms reported in patients receiving systemic fluoroquinolones. Epidemiologic studies indicate an increased risk of aortic aneurysm and dissection within 2 months following use of systemic fluoroquinolones, particularly in geriatric patients. Cause for this increased risk not identified. Unless there are no other treatment options, do not use systemic fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, in patients who have an aortic aneurysm or are at increased risk for an aortic aneurysm. This includes geriatric patients and patients with peripheral atherosclerotic vascular disease, hypertension, or certain genetic conditions (e.g., Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome). If patient reports adverse effects suggestive of aortic aneurysm or dissection, immediately discontinue the fluoroquinolone. (See Advice to Patients.) Systemic fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, are associated with alterations in blood glucose concentrations, including symptomatic hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Blood glucose disturbances during fluoroquinolone therapy usually have occurred in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving an oral antidiabetic agent (e.g., glyburide) or insulin. Severe cases of hypoglycemia resulting in coma or death reported with some systemic fluoroquinolones. Although most reported cases of hypoglycemic coma involved patients with risk factors for hypoglycemia (e.g., older age, diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, concomitant use of antidiabetic agents [especially sulfonylureas]), some involved patients receiving a fluoroquinolone who were not diabetic and not receiving an oral antidiabetic agent or insulin. Carefully monitor blood glucose concentrations when moxifloxacin used in diabetic patients receiving antidiabetic agents. If a hypoglycemic reaction occurs, discontinue the fluoroquinolone and initiate appropriate therapy immediately. (See Advice to Patients.) Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, cause arthropathy and osteochondrosis in immature animals of various species. Permanent lesions in cartilage reported in moxifloxacin studies in immature dogs. Safety and efficacy not established in children and adolescents <18 years of age (see Pediatric Use under Cautions) or in pregnant or lactating women (see Pregnancy and see Lactation under Cautions). Treatment with anti-infectives alters normal colon flora and may permit overgrowth of Clostridioides difficile (formerly known as Clostridium difficile ). C. difficile infection (CDI) and C. difficile -associated diarrhea and colitis (CDAD; also known as antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis or pseudomembranous colitis) reported with nearly all anti-infectives, including moxifloxacin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to development of CDAD; hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile are associated with increased morbidity and mortality since they may be refractory to anti-infectives and colectomy may be required. Consider CDAD if diarrhea develops and manage accordingly. Careful medical history necessary since CDAD may occur as late as 2 months or longer after anti-infective therapy is discontinued. If CDAD suspected or confirmed, discontinue anti-infectives not directed against C. difficile as soon as possible. Initiate appropriate anti-infective therapy directed against C. difficile (e.g., vancomycin, fidaxomicin, metronidazole), supportive therapy (e.g., fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation), and surgical evaluation as clinically indicated. Use for treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis or acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis only when no other treatment options available. Because moxifloxacin, like other systemic fluoroquinolones, has been associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions (e.g., tendinitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, CNS effects) that can occur together in the same patient, risks of serious adverse reactions outweigh benefits for patients with these infections. To reduce development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of moxifloxacin and other antibacterials, use only for treatment or prevention of infections proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When selecting or modifying anti-infective therapy, use results of culture and in vitro susceptibility testing. In the absence of such data, consider local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns when selecting anti-infectives for empiric therapy. Information on test methods and quality control standards for in vitro susceptibility testing of antibacterial agents and specific interpretive criteria for such testing recognized by FDA is available at [Web] . Human data for moxifloxacin insufficient to inform any drug-associated risk regarding use during pregnancy. Based on animal studies, moxifloxacin may cause fetal harm. Not teratogenic in pregnant rats, rabbits, and monkeys at exposures up to 2.5 times higher than human exposures reported with usual dosage, but embryofetal toxicity (e.g., decreased neonatal body weights, increased incidence of skeletal variations [rib and vertebra combined], increased fetal loss) observed in pregnant rats or rabbits at dosages associated with maternal toxicity. Advise pregnant women of potential risk to fetus. Not known whether distributed into human milk; distributed into milk in rats. Consider developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding along with the mother's clinical need for moxifloxacin; also consider potential adverse effects on breast-fed infant from the drug or underlying maternal condition. Efficacy not established for any indication in children or adolescents <18 years of age. Limited data available from a clinical study in pediatric patients â¥3 months of age indicate overall safety profile of the drug in pediatric patients is comparable to that reported in adults. Like other fluoroquinolones, moxifloxacin causes arthropathy in juvenile animals. (See Musculoskeletal Effects under Cautions.) AAP states use of a systemic fluoroquinolone may be justified in children <18 years of age in certain specific circumstances when there are no safe and effective alternatives and the drug is known to be effective. No overall differences in safety or efficacy relative to younger adults. Risk of severe tendon disorders, including tendon rupture, is increased in older adults (usually those >60 years of age). This risk is further increased in those receiving concomitant corticosteroids. (See Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture under Cautions.) Use caution in geriatric adults, especially those receiving concomitant corticosteroids. Risk of QT interval prolongation may be increased in geriatric patients. (See Prolongation of QT Interval under Cautions.) Risk of aortic aneurysm and dissection may be increased in geriatric patients. (See Risk of Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection under Cautions.) Dosage adjustments not necessary in adults with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A, B, or C). Use with caution in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment; monitor ECGs in those with liver cirrhosis. Metabolic disturbances associated with hepatic insufficiency may lead to QT interval prolongation. Dosage adjustments not necessary in adults with renal impairment.

644,Mycophenolate mofetil,"Mycophenolate belongs to a group of medicines known as immunosuppressive agents. It is used with other medicines (eg, cyclosporine, steroid medicine) to lower the body's natural immunity in patients who receive organ transplants (eg, kidney, heart, or liver). When a patient receives an organ transplant, the body's white blood cells will try to get rid of (reject) the transplanted organ. Mycophenolate prevents the white blood cells from rejecting the transplanted organ. This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.","It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits . Your doctor will do blood tests to make sure that mycophenolate is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.

651,Naloxone,"Naloxone is an FDA approved medicine used to quickly reverse an opioid overdose . Naloxone is a opioid antagonist that works by attaching to opioid receptors and therefore reverses and blocks the effects of other opioids. Naloxone should be used as soon as possible to treat a known or suspected opioid overdose emergency if there are signs of slowed breathing, severe sleepiness or the person is not able to respond (loss of consciousness). Once naloxone has been given the patient must receive emergency medical care straight away, even if they wake up. Naloxone is not a controlled substance, according to the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Naloxone is available as a nasal spray ( Narcan 4mg, Rezenopy 10 mg, Kloxxado 8mg) or an injection ( Zimhi 5 mg/0.5 mL). Narcan nasal spray became approved by the FDA on March 29, 2023 as is an over-the-counter (OTC) medicine that is available without a prescription. Other naloxone products are still prescription medicines, but in many states, these products are available from a pharmacist without a prescription from your doctor, under state Naloxone Access Laws or alternate arrangements. Opioids are sometimes called a narcotic. Examples of opioids are buprenorphine , codeine , fentanyl , oxycodone (Oxycontin), heroin , hydrocodone (Vicodin, Lortab), hydromorphone , meperidine , morphine , methadone , oxymorphone , and tramadol .","In an emergency situation it may not be possible before you are treated to tell your caregivers about your health conditions or if you are pregnant or breast feeding.

If you are using any narcotic pain medication, the pain-relieving effects of the narcotic will be reversed while you are also receiving this medicine.","You should not be treated with this medicine if you are allergic to naloxone or any inactive ingredients in the injection or nasal spray. If possible, before you receive naloxone, tell your doctor if: Using naloxone while you are pregnant may cause opioid withdrawal effects in your unborn baby. However, having an opioid overdose can be fatal to both mother and baby. It is much more important to treat an overdose in the mother. You must get emergency medical help after using this medicine. Be sure all emergency medical caregivers know that you are pregnant. If you use opioid medicine while you are pregnant, your baby could become dependent on the drug. This can cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the baby after it is born. Babies born dependent on opioids may need medical treatment for several weeks. In an emergency, you may not be able to tell caregivers if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Make sure any doctor caring for your pregnancy or your baby knows you received this medicine.","Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to naloxone: hives ; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.

652,Naltrexone,"Naltrexone is a prescription medication used to treat alcohol use disorder (AUD) and opioid use disorder (OUD) to reduce cravings and help control physiological dependence. Naltrexone works by blocking the effects of alcohol and opioid medications, preventing the euphoria and intoxication (the âbuzzâ) these substances cause, and it also helps reduce the urge or cravings to use alcohol or opioids. For alcohol use disorder, naltrexone helps people lessen their drinking behaviors and avoid relapses, and over time, cravings for alcohol will decrease. For opioid use disorder, naltrexone prevents euphoria and reduces physiological dependence on opioids such as heroin, morphine, and codeine to help people avoid relapses and remain opioid-free. Low dose naltrexone (LDN) is used for conditions such as fibromyalgia, Crohnâs disease, multiple sclerosis, and complex regional pain syndrome, as it may work as an anti-inflammatory agent in the central nervous system. Use of low dose naltrexone is an off-label use and is not FDA-approved for these conditions. Naltrexone is available as an intramuscular injection (Vivitrol) and as oral tablets. The branded tablets ( Revia , Depade) have been discontinued, but generic versions are available. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist. Its mechanism of action (MOA) is blocking the mu opioid receptor. This medicine also modifies how the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and adrenal gland (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, HPA axis) interact to suppress the amount of alcohol consumed.","This medicine can cause serious side effects, including: Risk of opioid overdose.

Using opioids in the 7 to 14 days before you start receiving treatment may cause you to suddenly have symptoms of opioid withdrawal when you receive treatment. Sudden opioid withdrawal can be severe, and you may need to go to the hospital. You must be opioid-free before receiving naltrexone unless your healthcare provider decides that you don't need to go through detox first. Instead, your doctor may decide to give this medication in a medical facility that can treat you for sudden opioid withdrawal. Liver damage or hepatitis .

656,Narcan,"Narcan ( naloxone ) nasal spray is an over-the-counter medicine used to treat an opioid overdose emergency, Narcan works by rapidly reversing the opioid's effects. Naran should be given as soon as possible when an opioid overdose is suspected, and then the patient should also receive emergency medical care immediately, even if they wake up. Narcan nasal spray became FDA-approved on March 29, 2023, as an over-the-counter (OTC) medicine without the need for a prescription, however, it is unknown when the OTC Narcan nasal spray product will be available. Until the OTC nasal spray becomes available, the nasal spray with the prescription label will still be available from a pharmacist without a prescription from your doctor under state Naloxone Access Laws or alternate arrangements. Narcan nasal spray can be used for adults and children for known or suspected opioid overdose if there are signs of slowed breathing, severe sleepiness, or the person is not able to respond (loss of consciousness). Narcan works to block the opioid effect as it is an opioid antagonist as it competes for the opiate receptors in the brain and other areas of the body to help reverse the dangerous effects of the opioid so that the patient's breathing improves and they become more awake, and their blood pressure normalizes. Examples of opioids are codeine , oxycodone (Oxycontin), heroin morphine , hydrocodone (Vicodin, Lortab), fentanyl , methadone , oxymorphone , meperidine , tramadol , buprenorphine , and hydromorphone . Narcan was originally available as an njection, which has since been discontinued. The Narcan nasal spray is available as an over-the-counter medicine, so a prescription is NOT needed.","Narcan is used to reverse the effects of opioid medicines temporarily, it will have no effect in people who are not taking opioid medicines. Always carry a nasal spray with you in case of an opioid overdose emergency.

671,Nicotine,"Used for nicotine replacement therapy as a temporary adjunct in the cessation of cigarette smoking either unsupervised ( self-medication ) or in conjunction with a behavior modification program under clinician supervision. Nicotine replacement therapy considered one of several first-line therapies by USPHS for treatment of tobacco dependence. For additional information, consult the most current USPHS clinical practice guideline available at [Web] Nicotine replacement therapy provides alternative sources of nicotine that help reduce the withdrawal symptoms associated with nicotine dependence. Chewing the resin complex-containing gum may act as a substitute oral activity in behavior modification. Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) such as electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have been used to aid smoking cessation attempts; however, these products are not approved by FDA for this use and evidence is limited regarding their efficacy and safety. The role of ENDS relative to conventional nicotine replacement therapies for smoking cessation remains to be established. Transdermal nicotine has been used in the management of ulcerative colitis â  [off-label] .","Known hypersensitivity to nicotine, menthol (oral inhaler), or any ingredient in the formulation. Nicotine polacrilex gum in patients with temporomandibular joint disease. (See Oral and Dental Effects under Cautions.) Risk of nicotine toxicity (e.g., nausea, hypersalivation, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, perspiration, headache, dizziness, hearing and visual disturbances, mental confusion, weakness) and addiction. Sustained use of nicotine preparations is not recommended. Weigh risk of nicotine replacement against hazard of continued smoking concurrent with nicotine replacement therapy and likelihood of smoking cessation without nicotine replacement. Discontinue nicotine polacrilex lozenges if symptoms suggestive of overdosage (nausea, vomiting, dizziness, diarrhea, weakness, and rapid heartbeat) occur. Animal studies indicate fetal harm; pregnant women should attempt smoking cessation with educational and behavioral interventions before considering nicotine therapy. Use during pregnancy only if the increased likelihood of smoking cessation justifies potential risk to the fetus and patient of nicotine replacement and possible continued smoking. If used during pregnancy or if patient becomes pregnant, apprise of potential fetal hazard. Possible exacerbation of bronchospasm. Use oral inhaler with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease; other dosage forms may be preferable. Intranasal nicotine is not recommended in patients with severe reactive airway disease. Nicotine nasal spray may irritate nasal mucosa; use of nasal spray not recommended in patients with a history of chronic nasal disorders (e.g., allergy, rhinitis, polyps, sinusitis). Discontinue nicotine polacrilex lozenges if severe sore throat occurs. Possible increased risk of adverse cardiovascular effects; however, causal relationship between nicotine replacement therapy and cardiac complications not established. Discontinue therapy if irregular heartbeat or palpitations occur. Use with caution and only after careful evaluation in patients with coronary heart disease (i.e., history of MI, angina pectoris), serious cardiac arrhythmias, or vasospastic diseases (e.g., Buerger's disease, Prinzmetal's variant angina, Raynaud's phenomena). Benefit of nicotine replacement therapy must outweigh risks of continued cigarette smoking. Self-medication not recommended in patients in the immediate post-MI period, with serious arrhythmias, or with severe or worsening angina. Possible hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance with prolonged nicotine replacement therapy. Use with caution in hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, or insulin-dependent diabetes. Possible delayed healing of peptic ulcer disease; use with caution. Discontinue nicotine polacrilex lozenges if persistent indigestion develops. Use nicotine polacrilex gum with caution in patients with a history of esophagitis. Possible increased risk of malignant hypertension in patients with accelerated hypertension; use with caution in such patients. Possible perpetuation of hypertension; use with caution in patients with systemic hypertension. Transference of dependence on nicotine may occur; potential for abuse and dependence on nicotine nasal spray appears to be greater than that for other formulations of nicotine (i.e., nicotine polacrilex gum, transdermal nicotine systems) but less than that of cigarettes. To minimize withdrawal symptoms and the risk of dependence on nicotine, withdraw gradually or discontinue use of nicotine polacrilex gum or transdermal or intranasal nicotine after 2â3 months of therapy. Concern exists regarding possible risk of nicotine dependence transference from use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) such as e-cigarettes and vape pens in individuals, particularly adolescents, not previously dependent on nicotine but who subsequently transition to actual cigarette use. Commit nicotine polacrilex lozenges contain aspartame (NutraSweet ), which is metabolized in the GI tract to provide 3.4 mg of phenylalanine per lozenge. Risk of occlusal stress when nicotine polacrilex gum is chewed for long periods of time; may result in displaced dental restorations or loosening of dental inlays or fillings. Gum may stick to dentures, dental caps, or partial bridges; if excessive sticking or damage to dental work occurs, discontinue gum and consult clinician. Use nicotine polacrilex gum with caution in patients with a history of oral or pharyngeal inflammation, or dental conditions exacerbated by chewing gum. Discontinue nicotine polacrilex lozenges if mouth problems develop. Possible skin reactions (e.g., urticaria, hives, rash) with transdermal systems. Increased risk of such reactions in patients with some dermatologic conditions (e.g., psoriasis, atopic or eczematous dermatitis). If skin reaction occurs, discontinue transdermal system and contact clinician; topical corticosteroids and/or oral antihistamines recommended. Risk of contact sensitization with transdermal systems; serious reaction may occur with re-exposure to smoking or other nicotine products. Potential adverse nervous system effects (e.g., insomnia, headache, dizziness, lightheadedness). Category D. (See Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity under Cautions.) Distributed into milk. Use caution. Weigh risk of exposure to nicotine in drug versus risk of nicotine and other components of tobacco smoke from cigarettes. Safety and efficacy not established. Use or ingestion of used or unused nicotine replacement systems by children may cause poisoning or be fatal; keep used and unused containers out of reach of children. Risk of choking if nicotine oral inhalers are swallowed; keep out of reach of children. Insufficient experience in patients â¥65 years of age to determine whether geriatric patients respond differently than younger adults; select dosage with caution because of age-related decreases in hepatic, renal, and/or cardiac function and potential for concomitant disease. Not studied in patients with hepatic impairment; use with caution. Not studied in patients with renal impairment; clearance may be decreased in patients with severe renal impairment.

678,Nitroglycerin,"Management of angina pectoris secondary to CAD. Short-acting preparations (e.g., sublingual nitroglycerin tablets, nitroglycerin spray) used for acute relief of angina; also may be used for acute prophylactic management in situations likely to provoke angina attacks. Sublingual nitroglycerin is considered the drug of choice for acute relief of angina pectoris because it has a rapid onset of action, is inexpensive, and its efficacy is well established. Long-acting preparations (e.g., oral or topical nitroglycerin) used for long-term prophylactic management of chronic stable angina. While Î²-blockers are recommended as the anti-ischemic drugs of choice in most patients with chronic stable angina, long-acting nitroglycerin preparations may be substituted or added in patients who do not tolerate or respond adequately to Î²-blockers. Acute symptomatic relief of chest pain in patients with NSTE ACS, including unstable angina and non-ST-segment-elevation MI (NSTEMI). Sublingual nitroglycerin (0.3â0.4 mg every 5 minutes for up to 3 doses) is recommended in patients with NSTE ACS who have continuing ischemic pain; IV nitroglycerin may be used in patients with heart failure, hypertension, or persistent ischemia not relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin and administration of a Î²-blocker. Topical or oral nitrates may be an acceptable alternative to IV therapy in patients who do not have refractory or recurrent ischemia. Management of patients with acute MI. Expert guidelines for the management of ST-segment-elevation MI (STEMI) state that IV nitroglycerin may be beneficial in patients with STEMI and heart failure or hypertension. Experts state there is no role for the routine use of oral nitrates during the convalescent phase of STEMI. Systemic hypotension with resultant worsening of myocardial ischemia is a potential complication of nitroglycerin therapy. Therefore, avoid use in patients with or at risk of hypotension. Avoid use in patients with marked bradycardia (e.g., <50 bpm) or tachycardia (e.g., >100 bpm) and those with suspected right ventricular infarction. IV nitroglycerin is used to control BP in perioperative hypertension, especially hypertension associated with cardiovascular procedures; to control BP in patients with severe hypertension â  [off-label] or in hypertensive crises â  [off-label] for the immediate reduction of BP in patients in whom such reduction is considered an emergency (hypertensive emergencies), especially those associated with coronary complications (e.g., coronary ischemia, acute coronary insufficiency, acute left ventricular failure, postoperative hypertension [especially following coronary bypass surgery]) and/or acute pulmonary edema; and to produce controlled hypotension during surgical procedures. IV nitroglycerin has been used in the management of acutely decompensated (e.g., congestive) heart failure and other low cardiac-output states â  [off-label] . Current guidelines recommend a combination of drug therapies (e.g., ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors [ARNIs], Î²-blockers, aldosterone receptor antagonists) in adults with heart failure to reduce morbidity and mortality. IV vasodilators not shown to improve outcomes in patients hospitalized for heart failure; however, IV nitroglycerin may be considered as adjunct to diuretic therapy for relief of dyspnea in patients hospitalized for acutely decompensated heart failure who do not have symptomatic hypotension. Particularly useful in patients with heart failure and hypertension, coronary ischemia, or substantial mitral regurgitation. Tachyphylaxis may develop within 24 hours; some patients may develop resistance to even high doses. Used adjunctively in the management of cocaine overdose â  [off-label] to reverse coronary vasoconstriction and/or relieve hypertension or chest discomfort.","Known hypersensitivity to nitroglycerin, other nitrates or nitrites, or any ingredient in the formulation. Use of topical nitroglycerin (transdermal system) in those allergic to adhesives used in the system. Use of sublingual nitroglycerin tablets in patients with early MI, severe anemia, or increased intracranial pressure. Use of extended-release oral nitrate preparations in patients with functional or organic GI hypermotility or malabsorption syndrome. Concomitant use of selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil). (See Selective Phosphodiesterase (PDE) Inhibitors under Cautions) Concomitant use of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators (e.g., riociguat). (See Concomitant Use with sGC Stimulators under Cautions.) Selective PDE type 5 inhibitors can potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates and nitrites, possibly resulting in potentially life-threatening hypotension and/or hemodynamic compromise. PDE type 5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) are contraindicated in patients receiving organic nitrates or nitrites in any form (e.g., orally, sublingually, transmucosally, parenterally), given regularly or intermittently, or nitric oxide donors since severe, potentially fatal hypotensive episodes can occur. Clinicians unfamiliar with their patientsâ drug history, especially those involved in emergency care (e.g., for presumed MI or ischemia), should take a careful history so that concomitant use of organic nitrates or nitrites with selective PDE inhibitors can be avoided. Warn all patients receiving organic nitrates or nitrites about the potential interaction between the drugs and selective PDE inhibitors, even if they currently are not receiving the drugs, since there is substantial potential for patients to receive the drugs from another clinician, from a friend, with little or no clinical intervention (e.g., via the Internet), or illicitly. Warn all patients taking either selective PDE inhibitors or organic nitrates or nitrites of the potential consequences of taking the drugs within close proximity (e.g., within 24 hours of sildenafil; possibly more prolonged periods of risk with longer-acting PDE inhibitors) of taking a nitrate- or nitrite-containing preparation. Concomitant use of nitrates (e.g., nitroglycerin) or nitrites (e.g., amyl nitrite) with a sGC stimulator (e.g., riociguat) can cause additive hypotensive effects. Such concomitant use is contraindicated. Time course and dose dependence of this interaction not established; use of these drugs within a few days of one another not recommended. Severe hypotension, particularly in upright position, can occur even with low nitroglycerin doses, particularly in the elderly. Use with caution in patients who are volume depleted or have preexisting hypotension. Paradoxical bradycardia and angina exacerbation may accompany hypotension. Benefits in acute MI and CHF not established. If used in these conditions, careful clinical or hemodynamic monitoring for possible hypotension or tachycardia is recommended. Avoid long-acting dosage forms in the early management of acute MI or CHF since the effects are difficult to terminate rapidly should excessive hypotension or tachycardia occur. Allergic reactions reported rarely. Contact dermatitis or fixed drug eruptions reported in patients receiving nitroglycerin ointment or transdermal system. Anaphylactoid reaction reported; possibly may occur with any route. Tolerance to the vascular and antianginal effects of individual nitrates and cross-tolerance among the drugs may occur with repeated, prolonged use. Carefully individualize nitrate dosage to minimize the risk of tolerance; also consider potential risks of nitrate withdrawal. Intermittent dosing of nitrates (e.g., use of a nitrate-free interval of 10â14 hours daily) has been used in an attempt to minimize or prevent the development of tolerance to the hemodynamic and antianginal effects of the drugs. Consider the possibility of increased frequency or severity of angina during the nitrate-free interval. Possible cross-tolerance to sublingual nitroglycerin during long-term nitrate use. Nitrate dependence is possible (documented in daily industrial exposures); withdrawal manifestations (e.g., ischemic symptoms, MI, sudden death) can occur. Sublingual tablets: Category B. Sublingual nitroglycerin has been used for the treatment of angina during pregnancy without fetal harm. Lingual aerosol, lingual solution, ointment, transdermal system: Category C. Extended-release capsules, injection, sublingual powder: Data regarding pregnancy lacking. Some experts state that use of nitroglycerin during pregnancy does not appear to present a risk to the fetus; however, experience with the drug in pregnant women is limited. Use during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Not known whether nitroglycerin is distributed into milk. The low molecular weight of nitroglycerin suggests that some distribution into milk may occur. Caution if used in nursing women. Safety and efficacy not established in pediatric patients. Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of individuals â¥65 years of age to determine whether they respond different than younger adults. Severe hypotension, particularly in upright position, can occur even with low nitroglycerin doses, particularly in the elderly. Geriatric patients may be more susceptible to hypotension and may be at greater risk of falling. Use with caution in geriatric patients who may be volume-depleted, are on multiple medications, or who, for whatever reason, already are hypotensive. May aggravate angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, particularly in the elderly. Cautious dosage selection, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, because of possible age-related decreases in hepatic, renal, and/or cardiac function and concomitant disease and drug therapy. Headache (pulsating or throbbing sensation, potentially severe); hypotension (may cause dizziness, weakness, other signs of cerebral ischemia); cutaneous vasodilation with transient flushing.",No before section found.,No side effects section found
679,Nitrostat,"Nitrostat is a nitrate that dilates (widens) blood vessels, making it easier for blood to flow through them and easier for the heart to pump. Nitrostat sublingual tablets are used to treat a type of chest pain called angina . Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood.

686,Norvasc,"Norvasc (amlodipine) belongs to a class of medications called calcium channel blockers. Amlodipine lowers blood pressure by relaxing the blood vessels so the heart does not have to pump as hard. Norvasc is used to treat certain types of angina (chest pain) and other conditions caused by coronary artery disease (narrowing of the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart). Norvasc controls chest pain by increasing the supply of blood to the heart. If taken regularly, amlodipine controls chest pain, but it does not stop chest pain once it starts. Your doctor may prescribe a different medication to take when you have chest pain. Norvasc is also used alone or in combination with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) in adults and children at least 6 years old. Lowering blood pressure may lower your risk of a stroke or heart attack .","Before taking Norvasc, tell your doctor if you have congestive heart failure or liver disease. Drinking alcohol can further lower your blood pressure within the first 12 hours and may increase certain side effects of amlodipine. If you are being treated for high blood pressure, keep using Norvasc even if you feel well. High blood pressure often has no symptoms. You may need to use blood pressure medication for the rest of your life.

It's not known exactly how Ocrevus works in people with MS, but it targets and binds to B-cells expressing CD20 on their surface, which results in their destruction via antibody-dependent cellular cytolysis and complement-mediate lysis. B cells are a type of white blood cell that contributes to the development and ongoing disease process involved in MS in a number of ways. The CD20 antigen is mainly found on the surface of B cells, which are also known as B lymphocytes, making it a good target for MS and certain other conditions affecting B cells. Ocrevus was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2017.","Ocrevus can cause serious side effects, including: See ""What are the possible side effects of Ocrevus?"" below for more information about side effects.",,"Ocrevus may cause serious side effects, including: These are not all the possible side effects of this medication.

712,Olumiant,"Olumiant (baricitinib) tablets are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis , Â severe alopecia areata (hair loss) and COVID-19 in certain patients. These conditions may be caused by an overactive immune system causing inflammation. Olumiant works by blocking a specific protein (Janus kinase) that causes inflammation to help relieve the symptoms of these conditions. Olumiant is classified as a Janus kinase inhibitor (JAK inhibitor). In rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system attacks healthy joint tissues causing the joint to be inflamed. Olumiant reduces inflammation in RA to help relieve pain, swelling, and tenderness of the joints. In alopecia areata (AA), hair loss is caused by the immune system attacking the hair follicles, causing inflammation that interrupts hair growth. Olumiant blocks inflammation, which allows hair to regrow. Olumiant treats symptoms of alopecia areata, but it is not a cure, and if you stop taking the tablets, then your hair may fall out again. When used to treat COVID-19, Olumiant is associated with an improvement in COVID-19 symptoms and a reduced need for ventilators. While generally well-tolerated, some patients developed elevated liver enzymes as a side effect. Olumiant gained FDA approval on May 31, 2018.

738,Oxtella XR,"Oxtellar XR (oxcarbazepine) is a once-a-day anticonvulsant drug used to treat partial-onset seizures in people with epilepsy. Oxtellar XR is an extended-release tablet, which means it slowly releases the drug steadily over the course of the day. After you take Oxtellar XR, your body processes the drug into an active form called licarbazepine - a metabolite - that is responsible for most of Oxtellar XR's antiepileptic activity. Oxcarbazepine undergoes a process called metabolism to produce licarbazepine, its active 10-monohydroxy metabolite (MHD). Oxtellar XR works to help prevent seizure spread in the intact brain. During a seizure many neurons or nerve cells fire at the same time, creating a surge of excessive electrical activity. Oxtellar XR is thought to work by blocking voltage-sensitive sodium channels (VSSC). VSSC are integral membrane proteins that play key roles in the electrical signaling of cells. It's thought that by blocking VSSC, Oxtellar XR helps to stabilize hyper-excited nerve cell membranes, stop repetitive neuronal firing and diminish impulses between nerve cells. Oxtellar XR also affects calcium channels and increases potassium conductance, and this may also contribute to its antiepileptic activity. Oxtellar XR was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012.

747,Ozempic,"Ozempic is used for type 2 diabetes to improve blood sugar levels and lower the risk of stroke, heart attack , or death for adults with type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Ozempic for weight loss has been shown to be effective in clinical trials. Ozempic is given as a once-weekly injection under the skin of the belly, the thigh, or the upper arm using an autoinjector (pen). Ozempic works by helping the pancreas release more insulin, decreasing the amount of sugar your liver makes, and slowing the rate food passes through your body, making you feel full longer. This helps to lower blood sugar levels and lowers the risk of a major cardiovascular event. Ozempic is a GLP-1 agonist that works the same way as a natural hormone made in our gut called GLP-1. GLP-1 controls insulin release and gut emptying and regulates appetite and food intake. Ozempic works by binding to GLP-1 receptors, which results in lower blood sugar and A1C levels and may also reduce appetite to help with weight loss. Ozempic is FDA-approved to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and to lower the risk of major cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes. It should be used together with diet and exercise. Ozempic ( semaglutide ) should not be used for type 1 diabetes mellitus .","Call your doctor at once if you have signs of a thyroid tumor , such as swelling or a lump in your neck, trouble swallowing, a hoarse voice, or shortness of breath.

749,Paracetamol,"Paracetamol (Panadol, Calpol, Alvedon) is an analgesic and antipyretic drug that is used to temporarily relieve mild-to-moderate pain and fever. It is commonly included as an ingredient in cold and flu medications and is also used on its own. Paracetamol is exactly the same drug as acetaminophen (Tylenol). Paracetamol is the drug's name assigned using the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) generic name system. Paracetamol is the name used for the drug in places such as Europe, Australia, New Zealand and India. Acetaminophen is the generic name assigned using the United States Adopted Names (USAN) system. Acetaminophen is the name used in countries such as the US, Canada and Japan. Usually the INN and USAN generic names for a drug are the same and don't differ between countries. It is not clear exactly how paracetamol works. However, it is thought to work by blocking chemical messengers in the brain that let us know when we're in pain and by affecting the chemical messengers that regulate our body temperature. The evidence suggests that paracetamol inhibits the production of prostaglandins, which are made by the body to deal with illness and injury. It's also thought to act on the serotonergic, opioid, nitric oxide and cannabinoid pathways. Paracetamol was first made in 1878, but only became more widely used in the 1950s. Today paracetamol is one of the most widely used painkillers in the world. Branded and generic versions of this drug are available.",Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is found in many different OTC cold and flu medications.

761,Phenylephrine,"Oral and nasal phenylephrine are used as nasal decongestants to temporarily unblock a nose or relieve sinus pressure in people with nasal and sinus congestion caused by colds, allergies, or hay fever. While phenylephrine can provide some symptom relief, it doesn't treat the underlying cause or speed recovery. Injectable phenylephrine may be used in a hospital setting to increase blood pressure in adults with significantly low blood pressure caused primarily by vasodilation (a widening of the blood vessels), as a result of septic shock or anesthesia. Phenylephrine works by directly stimulating receptors in the blood vessels of the nose and other parts of the body (called alpha-1 adrenergic receptors), causing vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels). This reduces nasal congestion by preventing fluid from draining from the blood vessels into the tissues lining the nasal passages. At higher dosages, phenylephrine increases blood pressure and reduces heart rate and cardiac output (particularly in people with preexisting heart disease). Phenylephrine has been available for over 60 years, which means it wasn't subject to the same rigorous scrutiny by the FDA as newer medicines.",No warnings section found.,"Do not use phenylephrine if you have used an MAO inhibitor in the past 14 days.

Everyone has osteoclasts that dissolve old and damaged bone and osteoblasts that form new bones and add growth to existing bone tissue. Prolia works by stopping the formation of osteoclasts before they can reach and damage the bone. It binds to RANKL, which is a protein on the membrane of osteoclasts that is essential for their formation, function, and survival. This inhibits osteoclast formation, which decreases bone resorption and increases bone mass and strength in both cortical (hard bone) and trabecular (spongy bone) bone. Prolia is a monoclonal antibody that targets and inhibits RANK ligand (RANKL). Prolia was FDA-approved on June 1, 2010. Xgeva is another brand of denosumab approved on the same date that may be used to prevent bone fractures, other skeletal conditions, and high blood calcium levels in certain people with cancer. Xgeva and Prolia have different dosages and uses and are not interchangeable (see Xgeva vs Prolia: How do they compare? for more information). Jubbonti (denosumab-bbdz) is an interchangeable biosimilar to Prolia that was FDA-approved on 5 March 2024. An interchangeable biosimilar is a biological product that can be substituted in the pharmacy for the reference biologic because there are no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency.","Prolia carries a boxed warning for life-threatening severe hypocalcemia (very low calcium levels); the risk is higher in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly those on dialysis. The risk increases even more in those with CKD who also have a condition known as mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). Your healthcare provider will evaluate you for hypocalcemia and CKD-MBD before starting treatment and monitor you throughout. Pre-existing low calcium levels should be corrected before starting treatment. If you receive Prolia, you should not receive Xgeva, Wyost, or Jubbonti. Prolia contains the same medicine (denosumab). Serious and life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with Prolia, including anaphylaxis. Seek emergency help or tell your doctor immediately if you experience shortness of breath, throat tightness, swelling of the airways and throat, itching, low blood pressure, or hives. Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported with Prolia. A routine oral exam should be performed before Prolia treatment and preventive dentistry undertaken if necessary, especially for those with risk factors such as prior tooth extraction, dental implants, oral surgery, cancer,Â  or poor oral hygiene. Good oral hygiene practices should be maintained during treatment with Prolia. Atypical low energy or low trauma femoral fractures have been reported with Prolia. Contact your doctor immediately if you develop thigh or groin pain. Multiple vertebral fractures have been reported following Prolia discontinuation. Your healthcare provider should consider transitioning you to another antiresorptive agent. Serious infections including skin infections may occur, including those leading to hospitalization. Seek emergency help or tell your healthcare provider immediately if you develop any signs or symptoms of an infection, including cellulitis (symptoms include a red, swollen, and painful area of skin that is warm and tender to the touch.

787,Promacta,"Promacta is a man-made form of a protein that stimulates cells in the bone marrow to produce more platelets (blood-clotting cells). Eltrombopag belongs to a class of medications called thrombopoietin receptor agonists. Promacta is used to increase the number of platelets (cells that help the blood clot) to decrease the risk of bleeding in adults and children one year of age and older who have chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP; an ongoing condition that may cause unusual bruising or bleeding due to an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood) and who have not been helped or cannot be treated with other treatments, including medications or surgery to remove the spleen. Promacta is also used to increase the number of platelets in people who have hepatitis C (a viral infection that may damage the liver) so that they can begin and continue treatment with interferon (Peginterferon, Pegintron, others) and ribavirin (Rebetol). Promacta is also used in combination with other medications to treat aplastic anemia (condition in which the body does not make enough new blood cells) in adults and children 2 years of age and older. Promacta is also used to treat aplastic anemia in adults who have not been helped with other medications. Promacta is used to increase the number of platelets enough to decrease the risk of bleeding in people with ITP or aplastic anemia, or to allow treatment with interferon and ribavirin in people with hepatitis C. However it is not used to increase the number of platelets to a normal level. Promacta should not be used to treat people who have low numbers of platelets due to conditions other than ITP, hepatitis C, or aplastic anemia. Promacta is not for use in treating myelodysplastic syndrome (also called ""preleukemia"").","Before you take Promacta tell your doctor if you have kidney disease, blood cancer, a bone marrow disorder, high platelet levels, liver problems (if you are not being treated for hepatitis C), a history of cataracts or blood clot, if your spleen has been removed, or if you are of East Asian descent.

839,Renflexis,"Renflexis (infliximab-abda) is a monocloncal antibody used to treat a range of inflammatory autoimmune diseases. Renflexis is a biological drug and one of four biosimilars of Remicade (infliximab). Biosimilar of Remicade are highly similar versions of the drug, which are designed to have the same effect, but which are not identical. Renflexis works in the same way as the other versions of infliximab, by blocking the damage that results from too much tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Renflexis binds to TNF-alpha, which stops it from interacting with its receptors and activating certain processes. TNF-alpha is a protein and inflammatory cytokine which plays a key role in your normal immune response. It is involved in your inflammatory response and also helps to fight off infection and cancer. Some people, however, produce too much TNF-alpha and this can cause an autoimmune disease to develop. Renflexis was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017, almost 20 years after the original version of infliximab started being used.","Renflexis may cause serious side effects, including: 1. Risk of infection Renflexis is a medicine that affects your immune system. Renflexis can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections.

877,Salbutamol,"Salbutamol (albuterol) is a medication used to relax and open up your airways. It is used to relieve wheezing, coughing, chest tightness and breathlessness in people with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Salbutamol is a fast-acting bronchodilator and reliever medication. It belongs to a class of medications known as short-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonist. Salbutamol works by stimulating the beta-2 adrenoceptors in your bronchial muscles, which are the smooth muscles lining the two large tubes (bronchi) that carry air from your windpipe (trachea) to your lungs. This causes your bronchi to relax and dilate, widening your airway for a short period of about 4 to 6 hours and making it easier for you to breathe. It can also act on beta-2 adrenoceptors in your uterus (womb). Branded and generic formulations of salbutamol are available worldwide. In many countries this medication is known by the generic name salbutamol, which is the generic name assigned using the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) system. In the US, however, salbutamol is known by the name albuterol (ProAir, Ventolin), which is the generic name assigned using the United States Adopted Names (USAN) system. Usually the INN and USAN names for a drug are the same. Salbutamol became available in the UK in the late 1960s and in the US in the 1980s. Salbutamol and albuterol are both marketed under the brand name Ventolin.","If your breathing suddenly becomes more difficult after using salbutamol, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

879,Saphnelo,"Saphnelo infusion is a prescription medicine used for moderate to severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus) in adults who are also receiving other lupus medicines .Â  Saphnelo (anifrolumab-fnia) works to reduce the body's immune and inflammatory response, to improve symptoms of SLE. Saphnelo is a monoclonal antibody that works by blocking type I interferon (INF-1) receptors. SLE is an autoimmune disease that causes pain and inflammation in your body. It is caused by your bodyâs immune system attacking healthy tissue instead of only fighting infections. Often SLE patients have elevated type I interferon stimulation which means too many unnecessary interferon signals are getting through, leading to inflammation in different parts of the body. Saphnelo blocks INF-1 receptors in the immune system, which decreases inflammatory signals and so improves the symptoms of SLE and reduces lupus flares. Saphnelo is not recommended for severe active lupus nephritis or severe active central nervous system lupus and is not approved for use by anyone younger than 18 years old Saphnelo infusion was FDA approved on July 30, 2021.",No warnings section found.,"You should not use Saphnelo if you are allergic to the active ingredient anifrolumab-fnia or any of the inactive ingredients in the injection.

900,Sodium Chloride,"Maintenance or replacement of sodium chloride and water for hydration. Prevention of muscle cramps and heat prostration secondary to fluid loss from excessive perspiration during exposure to high temperatures. Prevention or treatment of deficiencies of sodium and chloride ions (e.g., caused by excessive diuresis or excessive salt restriction). Extracellular fluid replacement (isotonic [0.9%] sodium chloride injection). Management of metabolic alkalosis in the presence of fluid loss and mild sodium depletion (0.9% sodium chloride injection). Management of severe sodium chloride depletion (e.g., presence of heart failure, renal impairment, during surgery, postoperatively) when rapid electrolyte restoration is essential (hypertonic [3 or 5%] sodium chloride injection). Management of hyponatremia and hypochloremia resulting from administration of sodium-free fluids during fluid and electrolyte therapy (3 or 5% sodium chloride injection). Management of extreme dilution of extracellular fluid following excessive water intake (e.g., resulting from multiple enemas or perfusion of irrigating solutions into open venous sinuses during transurethral prostatic resections) (3 or 5% sodium chloride injection). Emergency treatment of severe sodium chloride depletion resulting from excessive sweating, vomiting, diarrhea, and other conditions (3 or 5% sodium chloride injection). In general, isotonic sodium chloride solutions are used for parenteral replacement of chloride losses equal to or exceeding sodium losses; hypotonic sodium chloride solutions are used for parenteral maintenance of hydration requirements when only small quantities of salt are desired; hypertonic sodium chloride solutions are used for repletion in severe salt depletion syndrome. Management of hyperosmolar diabetes (hypotonic [0.45%] sodium chloride injection). Assessment of renal function status (0.45% sodium chloride injection). Priming fluid for hemodialysis procedures (0.9% sodium chloride injection). Initiate and terminate blood transfusions without hemolyzing RBCs (0.9% isotonic sodium chloride injection).

Measurement of cardiac output by the thermodilution method (0.9% sodium chloride injection as Thermoject system). Inhalation via nebulization, dilution of compatible drugs for nebulization, and tracheal lavage and irrigation (0.9% sodium chloride inhalation solution). An inhalation for cystic fibrosis patients to produce a sustained acceleration of mucus clearance and improve lung function â  [off-label] (7% sodium chloride solution).","When administration of sodium or chloride could be clinically detrimental. Bacteriostatic sodium chloride injection: Contraindicated in neonates. (See Pediatric Use under Cautions.) 3 and 5% sodium chloride injections: Presence of increased, normal, or only slightly decreased serum electrolyte concentrations. Thermoject 0.9% injection: Not for injection by the usual parenteral routes of infusion, including infusion through IV administration sets. 14.6% sodium chloride injection: Hypernatremia or fluid retention. Avoid use during and immediately following surgery, unless factors producing salt depletion are present. Because of renal retention of salt during surgery, administration of additional electrolyte may result in fluid retention, edema, and circulatory overload. Monitor for signs of postoperative salt intolerance (e.g., cellular dehydration, weakness, disorientation, anorexia, nausea, distention, deep respiration, oliguria, increased BUN). See ionic concentration and osmolarity tables under Dosage and Administration for specific sodium content information. Risk of sodium retention; use caution when administering solutions containing sodium to patients with hypervolemia, urinary tract obstruction, impending or frank cardiac decompensation, or renal or cardiovascular insufficiency (with or without CHF); to geriatric patients; or in clinical states with sodium retention with edema. (See Specific Populations under Cautions.) Some preparations contain aluminum; may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired, including in premature neonates. If such patients receive parenteral aluminum in amounts of >4â5 mcg/kg daily, aluminum may accumulate to levels associated with CNS and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. (See Pediatric Use under Cautions.) Infusion site and other reactions (e.g., fever, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis, hypervolemia, extravasation, phlebitis extending from the site of injection) possible. May occur because of the solution (e.g., contamination) or administration technique. Symptoms may result from excess or deficit of 1 or more ions in the solution; monitor electrolyte concentrations frequently. (See Electrolyte Disturbances under Cautions.) 3 and 5% sodium chloride injections are strongly hypertonic; may cause local pain or venous irritation or damage. (See IV Administration under Dosage and Administration.) If adverse effects occur, discontinue infusion; evaluate patient and institute appropriate therapeutic measures; save remainder of fluid for examination, if necessary. Possible fluid and/or solute overload following IV administration resulting in dilution of serum electrolytes, overhydration, congestive conditions, or pulmonary edema. Infuse 3 and 5% solutions slowly with constant observation of patient to avoid pulmonary edema. Risk of dilutional conditions is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentration administered. Risk of solute overload and resultant congestive conditions with peripheral and/or pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentration administered. Risk of benzyl alcohol toxicity in neonates with use of preparations containing benzyl alcohol. (See Pediatric Use under Cautions.) As patient's condition warrants and during prolonged therapy, evaluate changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance, both clinically and via laboratory determinations. May require additional electrolyte supplements or other appropriate therapy. Possible hypokalemia with excessive or prolonged administration of potassium-free solutions. Possible hypernatremia with excessive IV administration of sodium chloride. Hypernatremia may be associated with edema and exacerbation of CHF secondary to the retention of water. Risk of sudden hypernatremia and complications (e.g., cardiovascular shock, CNS disorders, extensive hemolysis, cortical necrosis of the kidneys) from inadvertent direct injection or absorption of a concentrated sodium chloride solution. Dilute hypertonic solutions prior to administration. (See Dilution under Dosage and Administration.) If infused in large amounts, chloride ions may cause a loss of bicarbonate ions, resulting in an acidifying effect. Patients with substantial electrolyte losses (e.g., resulting from protracted nasogastric suctioning, vomiting, diarrhea, or GI fistula drainage) may require additional electrolyte supplementation. Category C. Not known if sodium chloride is distributed into human milk. Caution if used in nursing women. Safety and efficacy of sodium chloride injection not established; however, the use of sodium chloride solutions in pediatric patients is referenced in medical literature. Use with caution in neonates and small infants; the volume of fluid may affect fluid and electrolyte balance. Some preparations contain aluminum, which may be toxic in premature neonates and in individuals with impaired kidney function. Premature neonates are at particular risk because of immature kidneys and because they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. (See Aluminum Content under Cautions.) Bacteriostatic sodium chloride injection containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative (antimicrobial agent) should not be used for diluting or reconstituting drugs for administration in neonates, nor to flush intravascular catheters in neonates. Large amounts of benzyl alcohol (i.e., 100â400 mg/kg daily) have been associated with toxicity in neonates. Several deaths have been reported in neonates weighing <2.5 kg in whom bacteriostatic sodium chloride for injection containing 0.9% benzyl alcohol was used for flushing IV catheters; some of these neonates received additional benzyl alcohol when bacteriostatic sodium chloride injection was used to dilute or reconstitute drugs. No substantial differences in safety and efficacy relative to younger adults. Substantially eliminated by the kidneys; monitor renal function since geriatric patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. (See Geriatric Patients under Dosage and Administration and also see Sodium Content under Cautions.) Use with extreme caution, if at all, in patients with liver cirrhosis. Use with extreme caution, if at all, in patients with severe renal insufficiency. Risk of sodium retention in patients with diminished renal function. Monitor renal function. (See Renal Impairment under Dosage and Administration and also see Sodium Content under Cautions.)",No before section found.,No side effects section found

911,Spinraza,"Spinraza is a type of medication called an antisense oligonucleotide. It is used to treat children and adults with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a type of motor neuron disease. It was the first drug to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this group of people. SMA is an inherited disorder that causes skeletal muscle weakness and wasting, which worsens with age. SMA is most commonly caused by mutations in a gene called SMN1 (survival motor neuron 1), which leaves the body without enough functional SMN protein to keep motor neurons healthy and functioning. A back-up gene called SMN2 also produces SMN protein, but only a small percentage of the protein produced by SMN2 functions properly. This is because when the protein is being made a portion of the gene called exon 7 tends to be skipped over, so the resulting protein isn't supplied with all of the right building blocks of information it needs to function properly. Spinraza works by fixing the protein produced by SMN2 so that it functions properly. It does this by making sure that the missing piece of information from exon 7 is included. Spinraza was approved by the FDA in 2016.",Spinraza can cause serious side effects including:,"Before you receive Spinraza, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:",Spinraza may cause serious side effects including: The most common side effects of Spinraza include: These are not all of the possible side effects of Spinraza.

924,Sulfasalazine,"Sulfasalazine is a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) used to treat and manage autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and an inflammatory bowel disease called ulcerative colitis. It is a slow-acting DMARD, taking time to build up and start working. Sulfasalazine helps to reduce pain and swelling and lowers inflammation in your body. It limits the damage that rheumatoid arthritis causes to your joints, helping to prevent disease progression. Sulfasalazine consists of the anti-inflammatory agent 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA, mesalamine or mesalazine) and the antibiotic sulfapyridine, which are linked by a bond. It's not fully understood how sulfasalazine works. Sulfasalazine is too big to be absorbed by your small intestine, but bacteria in your colon can break the bond between 5-ASA and sulfapyridine, which frees 5-ASA to work locally in your colon to help in ulcerative colitis. Sulfasalazine and its metabolites - the other drugs that it is broken down into - are also thought to have a range of immunomodulatory effects. They block or inhibit certain processes in your body, which helps to reduce the activity of your immune system. Sulfasalazine has been used since the 1950s. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a standard tablet (Azulfidine) and an enteric-coated, delayed-release tablet (Azulfidine EN-tabs) of sulfazalazine. Generic versions of these tablets are also available.

Tecfidera is a delayed-release capsule that is taken twice daily, it is available as 120 mg or 240 mg of dimethyl fumarate . Multiple sclerosis is a long-term condition that affects the brain and the spinal cord (central nervous system). It is caused by your immune system mistakenly attacking the protective covers (myelin sheaths) that surround the nerves of the spinal cord and brain. The inflammation and damage disrupt communication between the brain and other parts of the body, causing MS symptoms, including walking difficulties, feeling off balance, and blurred or double vision. In relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, there are flare-ups (relapses or attacks) of symptoms followed by periods of remission when symptoms stabilize or are no longer noticeable. Tecfidera reduces inflammation and damage to nerves that are caused by the immune system attacking the myelin sheath. It is not known exactly how it works, but it is thought Tecfidera's mechanism of action is the active ingredient dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and its metabolite, monomethyl fumarate (MMF) activates a pathway that is involved in oxidative stress, called the Nrf2 (Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) pathway.

An IDH1 mutation prevents young blood cells from developing into healthy adult blood cells, which can result in blood and bone marrow disorders such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Tibsovo may be used to treat adults with a confirmed susceptible IDH1 mutation with: Tibsovo targets the IDH1 mutation. In regular cells, the IDH1 gene produces the IDH1 protein, involved in normal cellular chemical processes. However, when the IDH1 gene is modified due to a genetic mutation, it leads to an abnormal version of the IDH1 protein and other substances such as the oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Tibsovo decreases levels of 2-HG, reducing blast counts and increasing levels of mature myeloid cells. Blasts are undeveloped bone marrow cells that will later mature into red blood cells, white blood cells, or blood-clotting platelets. They are typically absent in the bloodstream, and their presence signals a bone marrow issue, such as myelodysplastic syndrome. Up to 20% of people with cholangiocarcinoma, and 6% to 10% of people with AML have the IDH1 mutation. Tibsovo was first FDA-approved on July 20, 2018.","Tibsovo can cause irregular heartbeats that can be life-threatening, such as QTc interval prolongation. The risk is higher in people who also take other medications that cause QTc prolongation. Your healthcare provider will check the electrical activity of your heart with a test called an electrocardiogram (ECG) before and during treatment. Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome has occurred in 0.8% of patients treated with Tibsovo. Tell your doctor if you develop weakness on one or both sides of your body, sensory alterations, burning or prickling sensations, or difficulty breathing. Tibsovo can cause a condition called differentiation syndrome, which affects blood cells and can be fatal if not treated. It can occur within 1 day to 3 months after you start taking the treatment. Seek medical help right away if you have symptoms of differentiation syndrome: fever, dizziness, cough, trouble breathing, swelling, rapid weight gain, rash, or decreased urination. It is not known if Tibsovo is safe and effective in children.","You should not use Tibsovo if you are allergic to ivosidenib or any of the other ingredients in the tablets. To make sure you can safely take Tibsovo, tell your doctor if you have ever had: Tibsovo can harm your unborn baby. Your doctor may conduct a pregnancy test if you are a woman of childbearing potential before starting Tibsovo and you should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you inadvertently become pregnant or think you might be pregnant during treatment. Tibsovo can make hormonal birth control less effective, including birth control pills, injections, implants, skin patches, and vaginal rings. Use barrier birth control to prevent pregnancy: condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, or contraceptive sponge. Pregnancy may be less likely to occur while the mother or the father is using this medicine. Women should still use birth control to prevent pregnancy because the medicine can harm an unborn baby. It is not known if Tibsovo passes into your breast milk. Do not breastfeed during your treatment and for 1 month after your last dose.","Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to Tibsovo: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.

Avoid use in patients with early Leberâs disease (hereditary optic nerve atrophy); rapid and severe optic nerve atrophy reported. Anaphylaxis reported with parenteral preparations. Hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit ): Rash, mainly acneiform, reported in 20 or 44% of individuals receiving a 5- or 10-g dose, respectively. Administer an intradermal test dose prior to administration of vitamin B 12 for vitamin deficiency in patients who may be sensitive to cobalamins. Obtain hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B 12 , folate, and iron levels prior to treatment for vitamin B 12 deficiency. Monitor hematologic parameters as necessary during therapy. Some cyanocobalamin injection preparations contain aluminum, which may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum >4â5 mcg/kg daily accumulate aluminum at levels associated with CNS and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. Cyanocobalamin injection may contain benzyl alcohol as a preservative; benzyl alcohol has been associated with toxicity in neonates. (See Pediatric Precautions.) Transient elevations in BP reported in individuals receiving IV hydroxocobalamin. Use extreme caution if folic acid is administered to patients with undiagnosed anemia; may obscure the diagnosis of pernicious anemia by alleviating hematologic manifestations of the disease while allowing neurologic complications to progress. Oxalate crystals observed in the urine of healthy individuals and cyanide poisoning victims following administration of hydroxocobalamin. Category C. Distributed into human milk. Hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit ): Caution advised; no data available to determine when breast-feeding may be restarted following administration of IV hydroxocobalamin. Hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit ): Safety and efficacy not established. Cyanocobalamin: Benzyl alcohol has been associated with toxicity (âgasping syndromeâ) in neonates; each mL of cyanocobalamin injection (e.g., preparation manufacturered by Abraxis) contains 15 mg of benzyl alcohol.

1070,Vitamin D,"Vitamin D has to be one of scienceâs most misunderstood vitamins. For a start, it is not actually a vitamin, but a prohormone, which means that it is converted into a hormone by our body. It is also not just one substance, but five different substances, of which two have been identified as being the most important to humans. These are: In addition, research has discovered that vitamin D is not only vital for calcium absorption and bone growth and remodeling, but several other important processes as well, such as modulating cell growth and immune system function. Vitamin D acts on our bones, intestines, kidneys and parathyroid glands to keep calcium in balance throughout our body. Vitamin D receptors are also located within our cardiovascular system, lungs, pancreas, skeletal muscle, skin, and reproductive organs. In summary, vitamin D is a prohormone that is essential for good health. Only 10% of the vitamin D our body needs is obtained from food. The rest is made by our bodies when our skin is exposed to sunlight.",No warnings section found.,No before section found.,No side effects section found

1079,Vortioxetine,"Vortioxetine ( Trintellix ) is an antidepressant used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. Vortioxetine is thought to work by increasing levels of serotonin in the brain, serotonin is a neurotransmitter.Â  Vortioxetine's mechanism of action (MOA) is thought to be related to the inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT), it has other activities, including 5-HT3 receptor antagonism and 5-HT1A receptor agonism, but it is unclear whether these have an antidepressant effect. Vortioxetine is classified as a miscellaneous antidepressant , although some class vortioxetine it as a SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) or a serotonin modulator. Vortioxetine originally became an FDA-approved medicine on September 30, 2013, under the brand name Brintellix. In May 2016, Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc. and Lundbeck announced that Brintellix would be marketed in the United States under the new name Trintellix effective June 2016. The change comes after receiving reports of name confusion in the marketplace between Brintellix and the anti-blood-clotting therapy Brilinta (ticagrelor).","Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults: Some young people have thoughts about suicide when first taking an antidepressant. Stay alert to changes in your mood or symptoms.

Do not use vortioxetine if you have used an MAO inhibitor in the past 14 days, such as isocarboxazid , methylene blue injection, phenelzine , tranylcypromine , and others. After you stop taking vortioxetine, you must wait at least 21 days before you start taking an MAO inhibitor. Increased Bleeding Risk: Vortioxetine can increase the risk of bleeding events, and using aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other drugs that affect blood clotting may increase that bleeding risk. Discontinuation Syndrome: Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after a sudden discontinuation of these medicines. Whenever possible, a gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended. Activation of Mania/Hypomania :Â  There is an increased risk of mania or hypomania in patients who have bipolar disorder, so it is important to screen patients for bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania before starting treatment with this medicine. Angle Closure Glaucoma: Angle closure glaucoma has occurred in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles treated with antidepressants. Low blood sodium levels ( Hyponatremia): Can occur when taking some types of antidepressants and may be a result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with a serotonergic antidepressant. Also, patients taking diuretics or otherwise volume-depleted can be at greater risk. Sexual Dysfunction: Vortioxetine may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in males and females.","You should not use this medicine if you have a hypersensitivity or allergy to vortioxetine.

These contractions reduce how much water and electrolyte is absorbed from the gut, which leads to diarrhea. Carcinoid syndrome is a rare condition that affects people with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (mNETs). Xermelo is used together with medications such as octreotide ( Sandostatin ), which is a somatostatin analog (SSA) therapy; Xermelo is used with SSA therapy when the SSA therapy has not effectively controlled the diarrhea on its own. Medications like octreotide work by blocking the release of serotonin. When Xermelo is combined with SSA therapy, they work well together as Xermelo reduces how much serotonin is made, and SSA therapy decreases the amount of serotonin released, leading to an improvement in carcinoid syndrome diarrhea symptoms. Xermelo received FDA approval on February 28, 2017. Xermelo is indicated for treating carcinoid syndrome diarrhea in combination with somatostatin analog (SSA) therapy, such as octreotide in adults whose carcinoid syndrome diarrhea has not been controlled by SSA therapy.",Use only as directed.

1129,Xgeva,"Xgeva is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are made to target and destroy only certain cells in the body. This may help to protect healthy cells from damage. The Xgeva brand of denosumab is used to prevent bone fractures and other skeletal conditions in people with multiple myeloma , and in people with tumors that have spread to the bone. Xgeva is also used to treat giant cell bone tumor in adults and teenagers with fully matured bone structure. Xgeva is also used to treat high blood levels of calcium caused by cancer, when other medicines such as pamidronate or zoledronic acid (Zometa) have been used without success. Xgeva was FDA-approved on June 1, 2010. Prolia is another brand of denosumab used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women who have a high risk of bone fracture, and this was approved on the same date. Xgeva and Prolia have different dosages and uses and are not interchangeable (see Xgeva vs Prolia. How do they compare? for more information). Wyost (denosumab-bbdz) is an interchangeable biosimilar to Xgeva that was FDA-approved on 5 March 2024. An interchangeable biosimilar is a biological product that can be substituted in the pharmacy for the reference biologic because there are no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency.","This medication guide provides information about the Xgeva brand of denosumab.

1135,Xofigo,"Xofigo (radium 223 dichloride) is used to treat patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), symptomatic bone metastases,Â and no known visceral metastatic disease.Â Xofigo contains a radioactive material called radium 233, which concentrates in the bone where there is cancer and kills the cancer cells. Xofigo treatment may help patients live longer and may slow the cancer from damaging bones, so it may be longer before you have more bone symptoms or bone fractures due to the cancer. Xofigo acts like calcium and goes to areas of bone that grow quickly, which is where the cancer cells are. Xofigo works as once it binds to cancer in the bone, it gives off radiation that breaks the cancer cell's DNA, which kills the prostate cancer cells. Xofigo is given as a slow intravenous injection every 4 weeks for 6 injections. The half-life of Xofigo is 11.4 days. Xofigo treatment receivedÂ  FDA approval on May 15, 2013, for the treatment of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer who have bones symptomatic bone metastases and no known visceral metastatic disease.",Bone Marrow Suppression: Blood counts should be measured before the first treatment and also before every dose of Xofigo. Discontinue Xofigo if hematologic values do not recover within 6 to 8 weeks after treatment. Monitor patients with compromised bone marrow reserve closely. This medicine should be discontinued in patients who experience life-threatening complications despite supportive care measures.,"Pregnancy and male fertility: The safety and efficacy of Xofigo have not been established in females. Xofigo can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female. It is important to warn pregnant females and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Pregnancy is contraindicated. Male patients should not get female partners pregnant during treatment with Xofigo and for 6 months after stopping treatment. Male patients should use condoms, and their female partners (of reproductive potential) should use effective contraception during and for 6 months after completing treatment with Xofigo. Based on how Xofigo works, it may impair a male's ability to father children if they are of reproductive potential. Bone Marrow Suppression: It is important to be compliant with blood cell count monitoring appointments while receiving Xofigo. You should report signs of bleeding or infections to your healthcare provider. Increased Fractures and Mortality in Combination with Abiraterone plus Prednisone/Prednisolone: Patients using Xofigo have an increase in bone fractures and mortality when used in combination with abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone. You should talk to your healthcare provider about any other medications they are currently taking for prostate cancer. Fluid Status: It is important to stay well hydrated and to monitor oral intake, fluid status, and urine output while being treated with Xofigo. You should report signs of dehydration, hypovolemia, urinary retention, or renal failure/insufficiency to your doctor. Personal contact and radiation exposure to others: There are no restrictions regarding personal contact (visual or physical proximity) with other people after receiving Xofigo. You should follow good hygiene practices while receiving Xofigo and for at least 1 week after the last injection in order to minimize radiation exposure from bodily fluids to household members and caregivers. Whenever possible, when you use a toilet the toilet should be flushed several times after each use. Clothing soiled with patient fecal matter or urine should be washed promptly and separately from other clothing. Caregivers should use universal precautions for patient care such as gloves and barrier gowns when handling bodily fluids to avoid contamination.

It prevents pregnancy by stopping your ovaries from ovulating and releasing eggs. Xulane is a generic version of a patch called Ortho Evra, which has been discontinued.","Do not use Xulane if you smoke cigarettes and are over 35 years old. Smoking increases your risk of serious cardiovascular side effects from hormonal birth control methods, including death from heart attack, blood clots or stroke. This risk increases with age and the number of cigarettes you smoke. Do not use Xulane if you have an increased risk for blood clots. Do not use Xulane if your Body Mass Index (BMI) is 30 kg/m2 or more. Women with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or more who use Xulane may be at a higher risk for developing blood clots compared to women with a BMI lower than 30 kg/m2.

Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any of the above conditions. Your healthcare provider may recommend another method of birth control.,"Hormones from Xulane get into the blood stream and are processed by the body differently than hormones from birth control pills. You will be exposed to about 60% more estrogen if you use Xulane than if you use a typical birth control pill containing 35 micrograms of estrogen. In general, increased estrogen may increase the risk of side effects. See âImportant informationâ above. Xulane may cause serious side effects, including: To put the risk of developing a blood clot into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use hormonal birth control are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a blood clot. The likelihood of developing a serious blood clot for women who use hormonal birth control is between 3 and 12, for pregnant women is between 5 and 20, and for women in the first 12 weeks after delivering a baby (postpartum) is between 40 and 65. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have: Other serious risks include The most common side effects of Xulane are: Some women have spotting or light bleeding, breast tenderness, or feel sick to their stomach during norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system use. If these symptoms occur, do not stop using the Xulane patch. The problem will usually go away. If it does not go away, check with your healthcare provider. Less common side effects are: Tell your healthcare provider about any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. These are not all the possible side effects of Xulane. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist. Call your healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. Does hormonal birth control cause cancer? It is not known if hormonal birth control causes breast cancer. Some studies, but not all, suggest that there could be a slight increase in the risk of breast cancer among current users with longer duration of use. If you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use hormonal birth control because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones. Women who use hormonal birth control methods may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners."

This vaccine will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body. You should receive the vaccine at least 10 days prior to your arrival in an area where you may be exposed to the virus. This vaccine is also recommended for people who work in a research laboratory and may be exposed to yellow fever virus through needle-stick accidents or inhalation of viral droplets in the air. Like any vaccine, the yellow fever vaccine may not provide protection from disease in every person.",You should not receive a booster vaccine if you had a life threatening allergic reaction after the first shot.,"You should not receive this vaccine if you have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a yellow fever vaccine, or if you have: an allergy to eggs or chicken proteins; cancer, leukemia , or lymphoma ; a weak immune system caused by disease (such as cancer, HIV, or AIDS), or by taking certain medicines such as steroids; a disorder such as myasthenia gravis ; a disease or tumor of the thymus gland, or if your thymus gland has been surgically removed; or if you have received a transplant. Children younger than 9 months should not receive yellow fever vaccine. If you have a high risk of exposure to yellow fever, you may need to receive the vaccine even if you have an allergy to eggs or chicken products. Your doctor can give you the vaccine in several small doses to avoid an allergic reaction. In special cases, a doctor or health official may determine that an adult 60 years and older should receive a yellow fever vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have ever had: a seizure; a neurologic disorder or disease affecting the brain (or if this was a reaction to a previous vaccine); a bleeding or blood clotting disorder such as hemophilia ; or Guillain BarrÃ© syndrome. You can still receive a vaccine if you have a minor cold. In the case of a more severe illness with a fever or any type of infection, wait until you get better before receiving this vaccine. Vaccines may be harmful to an unborn baby and generally should not be given to a pregnant woman. However, not vaccinating the mother could be more harmful to the baby if the mother becomes infected with a disease that this vaccine could prevent. Your doctor will decide whether you should receive this vaccine, especially if you have a high risk of infection with yellow fever. Ask a doctor if it is safe to breastfeed after receiving this vaccine. Do not breastfeed if the child is less than 9 months old .","Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction: hives; wheezing , chest tightness, difficult breathing, swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.
